## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **This is Planning Mode** - No searches executed yet
2. **Critical path first** - Don't skip feasibility checks
3. **2GB RAM is the hard constraint** - Everything must fit
4. **ARM compatibility required** - X86-only software won't work
5. **24/7 reliability is the goal** - Stability > features
6. **Document thoroughly** - Future-you will thank present-you
7. **Confidence matters** - Better to admit uncertainty than guess
