## Clarification Protocol

### When to Ask for Clarification

**ALWAYS ask if:**
- ‚ùì User request is vague ("research X" without specifics)
- ‚ùì Success criteria are unclear
- ‚ùì Constraints are missing (budget, timeline, scale)
- ‚ùì Platform/technology stack is ambiguous
- ‚ùì Use case context is insufficient
- ‚ùì Multiple interpretations are possible

**Example triggers:**
- "Research Kubernetes" ‚Üí Which aspect? Deployment? Architecture? Costs?
- "Find the best database" ‚Üí Best for what workload? Scale? Budget?
- "Look into monitoring" ‚Üí For what system? What metrics matter?

### Clarification Question Template

```markdown
# Research Request Clarification

3. [Research topic 3]

Does this align with what you need?

---

**Please answer these questions so I can research exactly what you need!**
Once you confirm, I'll launch the full research workflow.
```

### Example: Vague Request Clarification

**User request:** "Research monitoring solutions for my server"

**Orchestrator response:**
```markdown
# Research Request Clarification

I'd like to ensure I research the right monitoring solution for your specific needs.

## About Your Request: "monitoring solutions for my server"

### 1. Server Context
- **What kind of server?** (Web server? Database? Application server? All-in-one?)
- **What OS/platform?** (Linux? Windows? Docker? Kubernetes?)
- **What's the hardware?** (Cloud VM? Bare metal? SBC like Raspberry Pi?)
- **What's the scale?** (Single server? Cluster? Edge devices?)

### 2. What Do You Want to Monitor?
- [ ] System resources (CPU, RAM, disk, network)
- [ ] Application performance (response time, errors)
- [ ] Logs (centralized logging)
- [ ] Services/processes (uptime, status)
- [ ] Security (intrusion detection, audit logs)
- [ ] Custom metrics (business KPIs, domain-specific data)

### 3. Constraints
- **Budget:** (Free/open-source only? Or willing to pay for commercial?)
- **Complexity:** (Simple setup preferred? Or complex is fine?)
- **Resource overhead:** (Low resource usage required? Or resources abundant?)
- **Alerting:** (Need notifications? Email? SMS? Slack?)

### 4. Experience Level
- **Your familiarity with monitoring:** (Beginner? Intermediate? Expert?)
- **Team size:** (Just you? Small team? Large org?)
- **Time to implement:** (Need it now? Can spend weeks setting up?)

### 5. Existing Setup
- **Current monitoring:** (Using anything now?)
- **Technology stack:** (Docker? Systemd? Specific frameworks?)
- **Data retention:** (How long to keep metrics/logs?)

## Proposed Research Plan

Based on typical server monitoring needs, I'm thinking:

**Critical path:**
1. System resource monitoring options (Prometheus, Netdata, Telegraf)
2. Log aggregation solutions (Loki, ELK, Graylog)
3. Visualization platforms (Grafana, Kibana)

**High priority:**
4. Alerting mechanisms (Alertmanager, custom scripts)
5. Resource requirements for each solution
6. Setup complexity comparison

**Medium priority:**
7. Dashboard templates and best practices
8. Retention policies and storage requirements
9. Integration with existing tools

Does this align with what you need? Any adjustments?

## Research Decomposition

### Decomposition Rules

**Good research topics are:**
- ‚úÖ Specific and answerable
- ‚úÖ Independent (can be researched in parallel)
- ‚úÖ Scoped to 30-60 minutes of research
- ‚úÖ Have clear success criteria
- ‚úÖ Address a single question or aspect

**Bad research topics are:**
- ‚ùå Too broad ("research everything about X")
- ‚ùå Dependent on other research completing first
- ‚ùå Open-ended without clear deliverable
- ‚ùå Multiple unrelated questions bundled together

### Example: Good Decomposition

**User request:** "I want to set up a home NAS server with Docker"

**Decomposed into:**

**Critical Path (Must answer first):**
1. HW-01: What hardware is suitable for Docker NAS? (RAM, CPU, storage)
2. SW-01: What are the best NAS solutions that run in Docker? (OpenMediaVault, TrueNAS, DIY)
3. ST-01: What filesystem should be used for NAS storage? (ext4, btrfs, ZFS)
4. NET-01: What network performance is achievable with Docker NAS? (SMB, NFS speeds)

**High Priority:**
5. SW-02: How to handle Docker storage for NAS? (Volume configuration, bind mounts)
6. ST-02: What RAID or redundancy options work with Docker NAS?
7. SEC-01: What are security best practices for exposing NAS via Docker?
8. MON-01: How to monitor NAS health and performance?

**Medium Priority:**
9. BAK-01: What backup strategies work well with Docker NAS?
10. NET-02: How to integrate with existing network (AD, LDAP)?
11. SW-03: What additional services pair well with NAS? (Plex, Nextcloud)

**Low Priority:**
12. OPT-01: Performance tuning for Docker NAS
13. ADV-01: Advanced features (snapshots, deduplication)

### Dependency Mapping

Create a dependency graph:

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Wave-Based Execution

**Wave size:** 4-6 agents per wave (sweet spot for coordination vs speed)

**Wave timing:**
- Launch all agents in wave simultaneously
- Wait for ALL agents to complete before next wave
- Review findings between waves
- Adjust remaining waves if needed

### Example: 4-Wave Execution

```python
# Pseudo-code for orchestrator

def execute_research_plan(plan):
    """
    Execute research plan with wave-based parallelization.
    """
    results = {}

    # Wave 1: Critical Path
    print("üöÄ Launching Wave 1: Critical Path (4 agents)")
    critical_agents = [
        launch_agent("research-specialist", prompt=plan.critical[0]),
        launch_agent("research-specialist", prompt=plan.critical[1]),
        launch_agent("research-specialist", prompt=plan.critical[2]),
        launch_agent("research-specialist", prompt=plan.critical[3])
    ]

    critical_results = wait_for_all(critical_agents)
    results.update(critical_results)

    # Decision Gate
    if not all_feasible(critical_results):
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Showstopper found in critical path!")
        return create_pivot_recommendations(critical_results)

    print("‚úÖ Critical path validated. Proceeding with high-priority research.")

    # Wave 2: High Priority
    print("üöÄ Launching Wave 2: High Priority (4 agents)")
    high_agents = [
        launch_agent("research-specialist", prompt=plan.high[i])
        for i in range(4)
    ]

    high_results = wait_for_all(high_agents)
    results.update(high_results)

    # Wave 3: Medium Priority
    print("üöÄ Launching Wave 3: Medium Priority (4 agents)")
    medium_agents = [
        launch_agent("research-specialist", prompt=plan.medium[i])
        for i in range(4)
    ]

    medium_results = wait_for_all(medium_agents)
    results.update(medium_results)

    # Wave 4: Low Priority (optional, time permitting)
    if time_remaining() > threshold:
        print("üöÄ Launching Wave 4: Low Priority (2 agents)")
        low_agents = [
            launch_agent("research-specialist", prompt=plan.low[i])
            for i in range(2)
        ]

        low_results = wait_for_all(low_agents)
        results.update(low_results)

    return results
```

### Git Branch Strategy

Each wave gets its own branch:

```bash
# Wave 1
git checkout -b research/critical-path
[agents write findings]
git add research-findings/
git commit -m "feat: Complete critical path research"
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff research/critical-path

# Wave 2
git checkout -b research/high-priority
[agents write findings]
git add research-findings/
git commit -m "feat: Complete high-priority research"
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff research/high-priority

# [Repeat for each wave]
```

---

## Quality Control

### Post-Research Validation

After each wave, validate:

```python
def validate_research_findings(findings):
    """
    Validate research quality before proceeding.
    """
    issues = []

    for doc_id, doc in findings.items():
        # Check confidence justification
        if doc['confidence'] == 'High' and len(doc['sources']) < 5:
            issues.append(f"{doc_id}: High confidence with <5 sources")

        # Check for unanswered primary questions
        if doc['unanswered_questions']:
            issues.append(f"{doc_id}: Primary questions unanswered")

        # Check for missing implementation guidance
        if not doc['implementation_steps']:
            issues.append(f"{doc_id}: No implementation guidance provided")

        # Check source recency
        old_sources = [s for s in doc['sources']
                      if s['year'] < current_year - 2]
        if len(old_sources) > len(doc['sources']) / 2:
            issues.append(f"{doc_id}: >50% sources are outdated")

    return issues
```

### Quality Metrics

Track these metrics across all research:

```python
QUALITY_METRICS = {
    'avg_confidence': 0.0,      # Target: >0.7 (High/Medium-High)
    'avg_sources_per_doc': 0,   # Target: >10
    'pct_high_confidence': 0,   # Target: >60%
    'total_web_searches': 0,    # Track for cost estimation
    'avg_research_time': 0,     # Target: 30-60 min per doc
    'showstoppers_found': 0,    # Track for risk awareness
    'visualizations_created': 0 # Track coverage
}
```
