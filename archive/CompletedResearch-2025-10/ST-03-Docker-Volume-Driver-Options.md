## Executive Summary

For the Le Potato home server with Docker data-root on external SSD (/mnt/ssd/docker or /mnt/storage/docker), **the default local volume driver with named volumes is the recommended approach**. Third-party drivers like convoy or local-persist are unnecessary complexity for a single-host deployment. Named volumes provide the optimal balance of simplicity, performance, reliability, and backup capability. They survive Docker reinstalls/upgrades, work transparently with ext4 on USB 2.0, and integrate seamlessly with Docker Compose. Bind mounts should be reserved for development scenarios where direct host filesystem access is required.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Default Local Driver is Sufficient for Single-Host Deployments
**Source:** Docker Official Documentation, Multiple Stack Overflow discussions
**Reliability:** Official documentation + community consensus

The default local volume driver is perfectly adequate for single-host Docker deployments and is the most straightforward option without additional setup requirements. Named volumes using the local driver are created in /var/lib/docker/volumes (or custom data-root location) and provide all necessary features for production use:

- Automatic lifecycle management by Docker
- Persistence across container restarts and removals
- Easy backup and migration
- Better performance than bind mounts on macOS/Windows
- No dependency on third-party plugins

**Key advantages over third-party drivers:**
- No additional installation or maintenance burden
- Native Docker integration and support
- Consistent behavior across Docker versions
- Simpler troubleshooting and debugging
- Better documentation and community support

**When third-party drivers ARE needed:**
- Multi-host clusters requiring shared storage (NFS, GlusterFS)
- Cloud storage integration (S3, EBS, Azure Disk)
- Advanced features like encryption at rest
- Network-attached storage requirements

For a single Le Potato server with local SSD storage, none of these scenarios apply.

### Finding 2: Named Volumes vs Bind Mounts - Named Volumes Win for Production
**Source:** Docker documentation, Stack Overflow, LinuxServer.io discourse
**Reliability:** Official documentation + production experience reports

**Named volumes are superior to bind mounts for production workloads:**

**Named Volume Advantages:**
- Docker fully manages the storage location and lifecycle
- Platform-agnostic (work on Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Can be pre-populated with container image contents
- Easier to back up using docker volume commands
- Better performance on Windows/Mac with Docker Desktop
- Permissions handled by Docker (less host OS dependency)
- Survive Docker reinstalls and upgrades
- Can be shared between containers safely
- Volume drivers can add functionality (encryption, remote storage)

**Bind Mount Advantages:**
- Direct access to specific host filesystem paths
- Useful for development (live code reloading)
- Can mount existing host directories with established content
- Simpler mental model for some users

**Performance comparison:**
- Linux: Named volumes and bind mounts have similar performance
- macOS/Windows: Named volumes significantly faster than bind mounts
- Both are faster than container's writable layer

**For the Le Potato use cases:**
- Pi-hole config: Named volume (no need for direct host access)
- Grafana dashboards: Named volume (managed by Grafana UI)
- VictoriaLogs data: Named volume (better for database workloads)
- Development projects: Bind mount acceptable (for live editing)

### Finding 3: Volumes Survive Docker Reinstalls and Upgrades
**Source:** Docker documentation, Stack Overflow verified answers
**Reliability:** Official documentation

Docker volumes are explicitly designed to persist independently of the Docker engine lifecycle. When you run `apt-get remove docker-ce` (or equivalent), the /var/lib/docker directory remains untouched by default, preserving all volumes.

**Key persistence characteristics:**
- Volumes exist outside container lifecycle
- Remain on host even when no containers use them
- Not automatically removed (must use `docker volume prune`)
- Survive package manager uninstall/reinstall
- Data stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume-name> (or custom data-root)
- Volume metadata maintained in Docker's internal database

**Important caveats:**
- Some users report volumes not visible after upgrade (rare, usually metadata issue)
- Data typically still exists on disk even if metadata lost
- Always backup before major Docker version upgrades
- Test restore procedures before relying on them in production

**Best practice:** While volumes are designed to survive upgrades, maintain regular backups as insurance against edge cases and hardware failures.

### Finding 4: Docker Compose Named Volumes are the Standard for Production
**Source:** Docker Compose documentation, production best practices guides
**Reliability:** Official documentation + industry consensus

Docker Compose provides excellent volume management through the top-level `volumes:` key, making named volumes the standard approach for production deployments.

**Recommended docker-compose.yml structure:**
```yaml
services:
  pihole:
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    volumes:
      - pihole_config:/etc/pihole
      - pihole_dnsmasq:/etc/dnsmasq.d
    # ... other config

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    volumes:
      - grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana
    # ... other config

volumes:
  pihole_config:
    driver: local
    name: pihole-config  # Explicit name prevents compose prefix
  pihole_dnsmasq:
    driver: local
    name: pihole-dnsmasq
  grafana_data:
    driver: local
    name: grafana-data
```

**Best practices from production deployments:**
1. Use explicit `name:` field to prevent Compose auto-prefixing with directory name
2. Declare all volumes in top-level `volumes:` section for visibility
3. Use descriptive names with project prefix (pihole-, grafana-, etc.)
4. Set `driver: local` explicitly for clarity (though it's the default)
5. Avoid bind mounts in production except for config files needing manual editing
6. Mount volumes as read-only when possible (add `:ro` suffix)
7. Use environment variables for customizing volume names per environment

**Example with driver options (if needed):**
```yaml
volumes:
  data:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      device: /mnt/ssd/mydata
      o: bind
```

This creates a named volume that uses a specific host path, combining benefits of both approaches.

### Finding 5: Volume Backup Strategy - Native Docker Commands + Tar Archives
**Source:** Docker documentation, Augmented Mind blog, Stack Overflow
**Reliability:** Official documentation + verified community practices

**Official Docker backup method using temporary containers:**

```bash
# Backup a volume
docker run --rm \
  --volumes-from <container_name> \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar /data

# Alternative: Backup named volume directly
docker run --rm \
  -v <volume_name>:/source \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  ubuntu tar czf /backup/<volume_name>-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /source .
```

**Restore procedure:**
```bash
# Restore to a new or existing volume
docker run --rm \
  -v <volume_name>:/target \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  ubuntu bash -c "cd /target && tar xzf /backup/<backup_file>.tar.gz"
```

**Critical backup best practices:**

1. **Application-level consistency:**
   - For databases (VictoriaLogs), use database-native tools first
   - Stop containers before backup or use application quiesce
   - PostgreSQL: pg_dump, MongoDB: mongodump, etc.
   - Volume-level backups may capture inconsistent state

2. **Pre-restore cleanup:**
   - MUST delete existing data before restore
   - Restore overwrites files but leaves orphaned data
   - Results in mixed old/new data causing application confusion

3. **Backup storage location:**
   - Don't rely on local-only backups (host failure risk)
   - Copy backups off-host (rsync, cloud storage, NAS)
   - Follow 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 off-site

4. **Automated backup solutions:**
   - Offen: Self-hosted, supports S3/cloud providers
   - Duplicati: Encrypted, incremental backups
   - Restic: Deduplication, encryption, multiple backends
   - Custom scripts with cron scheduling

**Alternative backup approaches:**

**Direct filesystem copy (if Docker stopped):**
```bash
# Stop all containers using volume
docker compose down

# Copy volume directory
sudo rsync -aAHX /var/lib/docker/volumes/pihole-config/ \
  /mnt/backup/docker-volumes/pihole-config/

# Restart containers
docker compose up -d
```

**Live backup with rsync (read-only acceptable):**
```bash
# For volumes where eventual consistency is OK
sudo rsync -aAHX --delete \
  /var/lib/docker/volumes/grafana-data/ \
  /mnt/backup/docker-volumes/grafana-data/
```

### Finding 6: Volume Permissions and Non-Root Containers
**Source:** Docker forums, Stack Overflow, GitHub issues
**Reliability:** Community consensus on a known pain point

**The permission challenge:**
Docker volumes created with the local driver default to root ownership (UID 0), but many modern containers run as non-root users for security. This creates permission mismatches.

**Common permission problems:**
- Named volumes mount with root:root ownership by default
- Container running as UID 1000 cannot write to volume
- Bind mounts inherit host directory ownership
- Rootless Docker compounds the issue with UID mapping

**Solution 1: ENTRYPOINT script (recommended for flexibility):**
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN useradd -u 1000 -m appuser
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["/app/start.sh"]

# entrypoint.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Fix permissions at runtime
chown -R appuser:appuser /data
exec su-exec appuser "$@"
```

**Solution 2: Pre-create directory with correct ownership in Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN useradd -u 1000 -m appuser
RUN mkdir -p /data && chown -R appuser:appuser /data
USER appuser
VOLUME /data
```

When volume mounts on /data, it inherits the directory's ownership from the image.

**Solution 3: Docker Compose user mapping:**
```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    user: "1000:1000"  # Run as specific UID:GID
    volumes:
      - appdata:/data
```

**Solution 4: Bind mount with host ownership:**
```bash
# On host, create directory with desired ownership
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ssd/docker-data/myapp
sudo chown 1000:1000 /mnt/ssd/docker-data/myapp

# Bind mount in compose
volumes:
  - /mnt/ssd/docker-data/myapp:/data
```

**For the Le Potato project:**
- Pi-hole runs as root by default (no issues expected)
- Grafana runs as grafana user (UID 472) - may need entrypoint fix
- VictoriaMetrics runs as nobody (UID 65534) - check official image
- Test permissions after initial deployment, add fixes as needed

### Finding 7: ARM/Raspberry Pi Docker Volume Considerations
**Source:** Docker documentation, Raspberry Pi forums, ARM community
**Reliability:** ARM-specific deployment experience

**Good news: No significant ARM-specific volume issues found.**

Docker volumes on ARM platforms (including Le Potato) work identically to x86 systems:
- Default local driver fully supported
- ext4 filesystem on external SSD is standard and tested
- USB storage works but with standard USB caveats (see Finding 8)
- Volume drivers are architecture-agnostic (operate at filesystem level)

**ARM-specific notes:**

1. **Docker version support:**
   - 32-bit ARM (armhf) deprecated in Docker Engine v29
   - Use 64-bit ARM (arm64) for future compatibility
   - Le Potato supports arm64 natively

2. **Storage location recommendations:**
   - Default /var/lib/docker on SD card = bad (excessive wear)
   - Move data-root to SSD as documented in ST-01 and ST-02
   - External SSD dramatically improves Docker performance on SBCs

3. **Performance considerations:**
   - ARM CPUs slower than equivalent x86 for compression/encryption
   - Avoid volume drivers that add CPU overhead (encryption plugins)
   - USB 2.0 bandwidth (35-40MB/s) is the primary bottleneck, not ARM CPU

4. **Community best practices:**
   - Raspberry Pi documentation applies to Le Potato (similar ARM SBC)
   - External SSD for Docker data is standard recommendation
   - Named volumes preferred over bind mounts (consistent with x86)

**No ARM-specific volume driver needed.** The local driver is sufficient.

### Finding 8: External SSD USB Storage Reliability Considerations
**Source:** Docker forums, SBC community discussions, Synology documentation
**Reliability:** Mixed real-world experience reports

**USB external storage is viable but has known limitations:**

**Performance positives:**
- External SSDs achieve ~450MB/s (SATA speeds) internally
- USB 3.0 bottleneck: ~400-450MB/s (acceptable)
- USB 2.0 bottleneck: ~35-40MB/s (significant but manageable)
- Far superior to SD card performance and longevity

**Reliability concerns:**

1. **USB device stability:**
   - USB devices can "fall off the bus" during power fluctuations
   - More reliable than historical USB, but not as stable as SATA
   - High-quality USB cables and ports reduce risk

2. **Professional NAS vendors advise against USB for primary storage:**
   - Synology: HyperBackup won't backup from USB devices
   - Reasoning: USB less reliable than internal SATA/SAS
   - Recommendation: USB for temporary/backup storage only

3. **Data corruption risk:**
   - Removing USB storage at runtime can corrupt data
   - Sudden power loss may not flush buffers correctly
   - Less graceful degradation than internal storage

**Mitigation strategies for Le Potato:**

1. **Use high-quality external SSD and cable:**
   - Reputable brand SSD with good USB controller
   - USB 3.0 cable even on USB 2.0 port (better quality)
   - Avoid cheap no-name drives

2. **Configure fstab with safeguards:**
   - Use `sync` mount option to minimize buffer flush delays
   - Use `nofail` so system boots if drive disconnected
   - See ST-02 findings for complete fstab configuration

3. **Implement SMART monitoring:**
   - Monitor SSD health with smartctl
   - Alert on pending sector reallocations
   - Proactive replacement before failure

4. **Maintain regular backups:**
   - Don't rely solely on USB SSD as single copy
   - Backup Docker volumes to secondary location (NAS, cloud, etc.)
   - Test restore procedures regularly

5. **Periodic backup to SD card (insurance):**
   ```bash
   # Weekly cron job: backup critical volumes to SD card
   docker run --rm -v pihole-config:/source -v /opt/backups:/backup \
     ubuntu tar czf /backup/pihole-config-weekly.tar.gz -C /source .
   ```

**Verdict:** USB SSD is acceptable for Le Potato given:
- Home server use case (not business-critical)
- Regular backups maintained
- SMART monitoring implemented
- Awareness of limitations and failure modes
- Significant improvement over SD card

### Finding 9: Volume Organization and Naming Conventions
**Source:** Docker community forums, DevOps best practices, production deployments
**Reliability:** Community consensus from experienced operators

**Recommended naming convention for Le Potato project:**

```
<service>-<purpose>

Examples:
  pihole-config
  pihole-dnsmasq
  grafana-data
  grafana-provisioning
  victorialogs-data
  victorialogs-cache
  prometheus-data
  nginx-certs
  nginx-webroot
```

**Naming best practices:**

1. **Use descriptive, semantic names:**
   - Immediately understand volume purpose from name
   - Avoid generic names like "data", "config", "volume1"
   - Include service name as prefix for grouping

2. **Prevent Docker Compose auto-prefixing:**
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     pihole_config:  # Without name, becomes "homeserver_pihole_config"
       name: pihole-config  # Explicit name: "pihole-config"
   ```

3. **Use consistent separators:**
   - Choose hyphen or underscore, stick with it
   - Recommendation: hyphens for volume names (CLI-friendly)
   - Underscores acceptable in Compose file (YAML keys)

4. **Version-specific volumes when needed:**
   - `postgres-13-data` vs `postgres-14-data`
   - Allows side-by-side testing and rollback
   - Useful for major version upgrades

5. **Environment suffixes for multi-environment:**
   - `grafana-data-dev`, `grafana-data-prod`
   - Not needed for single-environment home server
   - Mention for completeness

**Volume organization in filesystem:**

With data-root at /mnt/ssd/docker:
```
/mnt/ssd/docker/
â”œâ”€â”€ volumes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pihole-config/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _data/          # Actual volume contents
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pihole-dnsmasq/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ grafana-data/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ victorialogs-data/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ _data/
â”œâ”€â”€ containers/             # Container logs and metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ image/                  # Image layers
â”œâ”€â”€ overlay2/               # Overlay2 storage driver
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

**Volume documentation:**

Maintain a `VOLUMES.md` file in project repo:
```markdown
# Docker Volumes

| Volume Name | Service | Purpose | Backup Frequency | Size Estimate |
|-------------|---------|---------|------------------|---------------|
| pihole-config | Pi-hole | Config and blocklists | Daily | 100MB |
| pihole-dnsmasq | Pi-hole | DHCP/DNS config | Daily | 10MB |
| grafana-data | Grafana | Dashboards, datasources | Weekly | 500MB |
| victorialogs-data | VictoriaLogs | Log storage | Daily | 10GB+ |
```

**Cleanup and maintenance:**

```bash
# List all volumes
docker volume ls

# List dangling volumes (not used by any container)
docker volume ls -f dangling=true

# Remove dangling volumes
docker volume prune

# Remove all unused volumes (CAREFUL!)
docker volume prune -a

# Inspect volume details
docker volume inspect pihole-config
```

## Detailed Analysis

### Context

The Le Potato home server will run multiple Docker services requiring persistent storage:

- **Pi-hole:** Config files, custom DNS entries, blocklists (~100MB)
- **Grafana:** Dashboards, datasources, plugins (~500MB)
- **VictoriaLogs:** Log data, indexes (10GB+ over time)
- **Prometheus:** Metrics data (~5GB retention window)
- **Development projects:** Source code, build artifacts (variable)

**Storage architecture:**
- Boot device: 256GB microSD card (Armbian/Ubuntu)
- Primary storage: 2TB external SSD via USB 2.0
- Filesystem: ext4 (per ST-01 recommendation)
- Docker data-root: /mnt/ssd/docker or /mnt/storage/docker
- Mount configuration: See ST-02 findings

**Requirements:**
- Persistence across container restarts and recreations
- Survive Docker upgrades and host reboots
- Backup and restore capability
- Minimal complexity and maintenance overhead
- Good performance on USB 2.0 + ext4 + ARM
- Clear organization for multiple services

### Methodology

Research conducted through:

1. **Official Docker documentation review:**
   - Volume storage drivers documentation
   - Best practices guides
   - Docker Compose volume specification
   - Backup and restore procedures

2. **Web searches targeting specific questions:**

   - "Docker volume naming organization best practices"
   - "Docker external SSD USB storage reliability performance"
   - "Docker Compose volumes configuration examples production"
   - "Pi-hole Grafana VictoriaMetrics Docker volume configuration"

3. **Sources consulted:**
   - Official Docker documentation
   - Docker Community Forums
   - Stack Overflow (verified answers)
   - GitHub issues and discussions
   - ARM/Raspberry Pi community forums
   - Production deployment guides and blogs
   - DevOps best practices articles

4. **Analysis focus:**
   - Single-host deployment scenarios
   - External USB storage considerations
   - ARM platform compatibility
   - Backup and disaster recovery
   - Permission management
   - Production reliability

### Results

**Clear consensus emerged across all sources:**

1. **Default local driver is sufficient** for single-host deployments
2. **Named volumes preferred** over bind mounts for production
3. **Volumes survive** Docker reinstalls and upgrades by design
4. **Backup strategy is critical** regardless of volume type
5. **USB SSD viable** with awareness of limitations
6. **No ARM-specific drivers needed** - standard approach works
7. **Permission issues solvable** with standard techniques
8. **Organization and naming matter** for long-term maintainability

**No significant disadvantages** to using default local driver with named volumes for this use case.

**Third-party drivers unnecessary** unless multi-host clustering or cloud storage integration required.

### Interpretation

The research confirms that Docker's volume management is mature and well-suited for the Le Potato deployment without requiring third-party plugins or complex configuration.

**Why the default local driver wins:**

1. **Simplicity = Reliability:** No additional software to install, configure, or maintain. Built into Docker Engine, well-tested, stable.

2. **Adequate feature set:** Named volumes provide all needed features:
   - Persistence across container lifecycle
   - Backup/restore capability
   - Sharing between containers
   - Automatic initialization from images
   - Lifecycle management

3. **Performance:** Direct filesystem access with no additional layers. Optimal for local SSD storage.

4. **Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with ext4 on USB, ARM architecture, and all Docker tools.

5. **Support:** Extensively documented, large community knowledge base, standard troubleshooting procedures.

**When NOT to use default local driver:**
- Multi-host Docker Swarm/Kubernetes cluster (need shared storage)
- Requirement for specific cloud storage (S3, EBS, Azure Disk)
- Need for volume encryption at rest (some security-critical deployments)
- Network-attached storage (NFS, GlusterFS, Ceph)

None of these apply to a single-host home server.

**The permission challenge is real but manageable:**
Modern container security best practices recommend non-root containers, which conflicts with Docker's default root ownership of volumes. However, standard solutions (entrypoint scripts, Dockerfile setup, user mapping) handle this adequately. Testing and fixing permissions per service is a one-time setup task.

**USB storage concerns are valid but acceptable:**
Professional NAS vendors discourage USB for primary storage due to stability concerns, but:
- Home server criticality is lower than business production
- Regular backups provide insurance
- SSD reliability far superior to SD cards
- Community successfully uses USB SSDs on SBCs
- Benefits (performance, capacity, cost) outweigh risks

## Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation

**Use Docker's default local volume driver with named volumes defined in Docker Compose.**

**Rationale:**
1. **Simplicity:** No additional software or plugins required
2. **Reliability:** Mature, well-tested, stable across Docker versions
3. **Performance:** Optimal for local SSD storage on ext4 filesystem
4. **Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with ARM, USB storage, Docker tools
5. **Maintainability:** Standard configuration, extensive documentation
6. **Adequate features:** Meets all requirements for single-host deployment
7. **Backup capability:** Standard tools and procedures available
8. **Persistence:** Survives Docker upgrades and container recreations

**Implementation approach:**
- Define all volumes in Docker Compose top-level `volumes:` section
- Use explicit `name:` field to control volume naming
- Prefer named volumes over bind mounts for production services
- Reserve bind mounts for development scenarios (live code editing)
- Configure with `driver: local` explicitly for clarity

**Configuration priority:** Implement during Phase 2 (Docker and services setup)

#!/bin/bash
# Restore Docker volume from backup

set -e

if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <volume_name> <backup_file>"
  exit 1
fi

VOLUME_NAME=$1
BACKUP_FILE=$2

if [ ! -f "$BACKUP_FILE" ]; then
  echo "Error: Backup file not found: $BACKUP_FILE"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if volume exists
if ! docker volume inspect "$VOLUME_NAME" &> /dev/null; then
  echo "Creating volume: $VOLUME_NAME"
  docker volume create "$VOLUME_NAME"
fi

echo "WARNING: This will DELETE existing data in volume: $VOLUME_NAME"
read -p "Continue? (yes/no): " confirm

if [ "$confirm" != "yes" ]; then

### Troubleshooting Tips

#### Issue: Permission Denied Writing to Volume

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/data/file.txt'
```

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check volume ownership
docker volume inspect myvolume
# Note mount point

sudo ls -la /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvolume/_data
# Check ownership and permissions
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Add entrypoint script to container:**
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
COPY entrypoint.sh /
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

# entrypoint.sh
#!/bin/sh
chown -R appuser:appuser /data
exec su-exec appuser "$@"
```

2. **Pre-create directory in Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
RUN mkdir -p /data && chown appuser:appuser /data
USER appuser
VOLUME /data
```

3. **Run container as root temporarily:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    user: "0:0"  # Run as root
    volumes:
      - appdata:/data
```

#### Issue: Volume Not Found After Docker Upgrade

**Symptoms:**
```
Error response from daemon: volume myvolume not found
```

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if volume data still exists
sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/
# or
sudo ls /mnt/ssd/docker/volumes/

# Check Docker volume metadata
docker volume ls
```

**Solutions:**

1. **If data exists but Docker doesn't see it:**
```bash
# Recreate volume (Docker will detect existing data)
docker volume create myvolume

# Verify
docker volume inspect myvolume
```

2. **If Docker's metadata corrupted:**
```bash
# Stop Docker
sudo systemctl stop docker

# Backup volumes
sudo cp -a /var/lib/docker/volumes /var/lib/docker/volumes.backup

# Restart Docker (may rebuild metadata)
sudo systemctl start docker

# Check volumes
docker volume ls
```

#### Issue: Volume Running Out of Space

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: ENOSPC: no space left on device
```

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check volume size
docker system df -v

# Check specific volume
du -sh /var/lib/docker/volumes/victorialogs-data/_data
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Clean up old data (application-specific):**
```bash
# For VictoriaLogs, adjust retention
# Update docker-compose.yml:
command:
  - '-retentionPeriod=6'  # Reduce from 12 to 6 months

# Restart service
docker compose restart victorialogs
```

2. **Move volume to larger storage:**
```bash
# Stop container
docker compose stop myservice

# Backup volume
docker run --rm -v myvolume:/source -v /mnt/backup:/backup \
  ubuntu tar czf /backup/myvolume.tar.gz -C /source .

# Create new volume on different storage
docker volume create --driver local \
  --opt type=none \
  --opt device=/mnt/largerssd/myvolume \
  --opt o=bind \
  myvolume-new

# Restore data to new volume
docker run --rm -v myvolume-new:/target -v /mnt/backup:/backup \
  ubuntu tar xzf /backup/myvolume.tar.gz -C /target

# Update docker-compose.yml to use new volume
# Restart container
docker compose up -d myservice
```

#### Issue: Slow Volume Performance

**Symptoms:**
- Container operations slow
- High I/O wait times
- Applications report slow disk access

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check I/O stats
iostat -x 5

# Check USB device performance
sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sda

# Monitor Docker I/O
docker stats

# Check for USB errors
dmesg | grep usb
dmesg | grep -i error
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify USB connection quality:**
```bash
# Check USB version and speed
lsusb -t

# Ensure USB 3.0 if available
# Check cable quality (try different cable)
```

2. **Optimize mount options:**
```bash
# Edit /etc/fstab
UUID=xxx /mnt/ssd ext4 defaults,noatime,nodiratime,commit=60 0 2
#                                                    ^^^^^^^^
#                                                    Increase commit interval

# Remount
sudo mount -o remount /mnt/ssd
```

3. **Reduce Docker logging:**
```json
// /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3"
  }
}
```

#### Issue: Cannot Remove Volume

**Symptoms:**
```
Error response from daemon: volume is in use
```

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Find containers using volume
docker ps -a --filter volume=myvolume

# Check volume details
docker volume inspect myvolume
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Remove containers first:**
```bash
# Stop and remove containers
docker compose down

# Or force remove specific container
docker rm -f container_name

# Then remove volume
docker volume rm myvolume
```

2. **Force removal (if stuck):**
```bash
# WARNING: May cause data loss if containers still running
docker volume rm -f myvolume
```

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| USB SSD disconnection during operation | Low | High | Use `nofail` in fstab; high-quality cable; SMART monitoring; regular backups |
| Volume permission issues break applications | Medium | Medium | Test permissions after deployment; implement entrypoint scripts; document fixes |
| Running out of volume space | Medium | Medium | Monitor disk usage with Prometheus; set alerts at 80%; implement log rotation |
| Data loss from hardware failure | Low | High | Regular automated backups; off-site backup copy; test restore procedures |
| Volume data corruption | Low | Medium | Use journaling filesystem (ext4); regular SMART checks; replace drive proactively |
| Backup restore fails when needed | Medium | High | Test restore procedures regularly; maintain multiple backup copies; document process |
| Docker upgrade breaks volume access | Low | Medium | Backup before upgrades; test in non-production first; volumes survive by design |
| Accidental volume deletion | Low | High | Use explicit volume names; avoid `prune -a` without care; regular backups |
| Volume naming conflicts | Low | Low | Use explicit `name:` in Compose; follow naming conventions; document volumes |
| Poor performance on USB 2.0 | Medium | Low | Accept USB 2.0 limits (~40MB/s); optimize for sequential I/O; consider upgrade to USB 3.0 device if Le Potato supports via adapter |

---

## Resource Requirements

- **RAM:** Negligible volume driver overhead (~10-20MB for Docker Engine metadata)
- **CPU:** <1% overhead for volume operations (filesystem-level, not CPU-intensive)
- **Storage:**
  - Per-volume overhead: ~100KB for metadata in Docker database
  - Actual volume data: Application-dependent
  - Estimated totals:
    - Pi-hole: 100MB (config + blocklists)
    - Grafana: 500MB (dashboards + plugins)
    - VictoriaLogs: 10-20GB (depends on retention period)
    - Prometheus: 5GB (2-week retention window)
    - Development: Variable (1-10GB per project)
    - **Total estimated: 20-30GB for all services**
- **Network:** No network overhead (local storage)
- **Power:** No additional power beyond SSD's normal consumption (~2-3W)
- **Administrative Time:**
  - Initial setup: 2-3 hours (Docker Compose configuration, volume creation)
  - Backup script setup: 1-2 hours (script creation, cron configuration, testing)
  - Ongoing maintenance: ~2 hours/month (verify backups, monitor space, cleanup)
  - Troubleshooting: Variable (budget 1-2 hours per issue)

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Docker Compose Auto-Prefixes Volume Names
**Symptoms:** Volumes named with project directory prefix (e.g., `homeserver_pihole_config` instead of `pihole-config`)
**Workaround:** Use explicit `name:` field in volume definition:
```yaml
volumes:
  pihole_config:
    name: pihole-config  # Explicit name prevents auto-prefix
```
**Source:** Docker Compose documentation, Stack Overflow Q&A

### Issue 2: Named Volumes Default to Root Ownership
**Symptoms:** Non-root containers cannot write to newly created volumes
**Workaround:** Use entrypoint script to fix permissions at runtime, or pre-create directory with correct ownership in Dockerfile
**Source:** Docker community forums, GitHub issues (widespread known issue)

### Issue 3: Volume Backups Capture Inconsistent State
**Symptoms:** Restored database volumes fail integrity checks or contain partial transactions
**Workaround:** Use application-native backup tools (pg_dump, mongodump, etc.) or stop container before volume backup
**Source:** Docker documentation, database administration best practices

### Issue 4: Old Data Remains After Volume Restore
**Symptoms:** Application behaves erratically after restore due to mixture of old and new data
**Workaround:** **MUST delete all existing data before restore** - documented in restore script above
**Source:** Docker documentation, Augmented Mind blog post on volume backups

### Issue 5: USB SSD May Drop from System Under Heavy Load
**Symptoms:** Docker containers suddenly unable to access volumes; USB device disappears from `lsusb`
**Workaround:** Use high-quality USB cable; ensure adequate power supply to Le Potato; check `dmesg` for USB errors; consider powered USB hub
**Source:** Raspberry Pi forums, SBC community discussions

### Issue 6: Volume Size Not Visible in `docker system df`
**Symptoms:** Difficult to determine actual disk space used by volumes
**Workaround:** Use `docker system df -v` for detailed volume sizes, or directly inspect with `du -sh /var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume>/_data`
**Source:** Docker documentation, Stack Overflow

## Performance Characteristics

### Expected Performance

**Volume operation latency:**
- Volume create/delete: <100ms (metadata operation)
- Volume mount/unmount: <50ms (bind operation)
- Container start with volumes: +100-200ms vs no volumes

**I/O performance (USB 2.0 + ext4 + local driver):**
- Sequential read: 38-40 MB/s (USB 2.0 limited)
- Sequential write: 35-38 MB/s (USB 2.0 + journaling limited)
- Random 4K read: 100-200 IOPS (USB latency limited)
- Random 4K write: 80-150 IOPS (USB + journaling limited)
- Metadata operations: Excellent (ext4 optimized)

**Comparison with SD card (baseline):**
- Sequential read: ~40-60 MB/s (SSD equivalent)
- Sequential write: ~20-30 MB/s (SSD 50% faster)
- Random 4K read: 30-50 IOPS (SSD 3-4x faster)
- Random 4K write: 10-20 IOPS (SSD 8-15x faster)
- **Lifespan: SSD 10-50x longer (10,000 vs 100,000+ write cycles)**

**Performance comparison: Volume types**
| Operation | Named Volume (Local) | Bind Mount | Container Writable Layer |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Sequential I/O | 40 MB/s | 40 MB/s | 30 MB/s |
| Random I/O | 150 IOPS | 150 IOPS | 80 IOPS |
| Metadata ops | Fast | Fast | Slow (overlay2 overhead) |
| Container start | +100ms | +100ms | Baseline |
| Backup ease | Easy (docker cmds) | Medium (rsync) | Difficult |
| Portability | High | Low | N/A (ephemeral) |

**Key takeaway:** Named volumes and bind mounts have similar performance on Linux with local storage. Named volumes provide better portability and management without performance penalty.

### Benchmarking Commands

```bash
# Test sequential write performance
docker run --rm -v testvol:/data ubuntu:22.04 \
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/data/testfile bs=1M count=1024 conv=fdatasync

# Test sequential read performance
docker run --rm -v testvol:/data ubuntu:22.04 \
  dd if=/data/testfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1024

# Test random I/O with fio (if available)
docker run --rm -v testvol:/data ubuntu:22.04 \
  fio --name=randwrite --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=16 --rw=randwrite \
      --bs=4k --direct=1 --size=1G --numjobs=1 --runtime=60 \
      --group_reporting --filename=/data/fiotest

# Cleanup
docker volume rm testvol
```

## Architecture Impact

### Changes Required to Project Spec

1. **Phase 2 (Docker Setup) additions:**
   - Document volume strategy (named volumes with local driver)
   - Define volume naming convention
   - Create volume configuration templates for each service
   - Document backup and restore procedures

2. **Docker Compose structure:**
   - All services use Docker Compose with explicit volume definitions
   - Top-level `volumes:` section in each compose file
   - Explicit `name:` fields to prevent auto-prefixing
   - Volume documentation in VOLUMES.md file

3. **Backup strategy (Phase 3):**
   - Automated backup scripts for Docker volumes
   - Cron jobs for daily/weekly backups
   - Off-site backup sync (rsync to NAS or cloud)
   - Regular restore testing procedures

4. **Monitoring (Phase 4):**
   - Prometheus metrics for volume disk usage
   - Alerts at 80% capacity
   - SMART monitoring for SSD health
   - Backup success/failure monitoring

### Dependencies Affected

- **Service deployment procedures:**
  - Each service requires volume definitions in docker-compose.yml
  - Permission testing needed after initial deployment
  - Volume initialization from backups (if migrating)

- **Backup system:**
  - Backup scripts must be configured for each volume
  - Restore procedures documented per service
  - Off-site sync configured (rsync, rclone, etc.)

- **Monitoring:**
  - Disk usage monitoring for /mnt/ssd
  - Volume-specific space tracking
  - Backup age monitoring

- **Documentation:**
  - VOLUMES.md file listing all volumes
  - Per-service volume configuration notes
  - Disaster recovery procedures

### Phase Priority Adjustments

No phase reordering required. Volume management integrates into existing phases:

- **Phase 1 (Hardware/OS):** No volume-specific tasks (SSD formatting covered in ST-01)
- **Phase 2 (Docker/Services):** Configure volumes as services deployed
- **Phase 3 (Backup):** Implement volume backup strategy
- **Phase 4 (Monitoring):** Add volume metrics and alerts

## Open Questions & Uncertainties

### Unresolved Questions

1. **Specific performance impact of non-root user entrypoint scripts:**
   - How much startup delay does permission fixing add?
   - Is there a measurable performance impact during runtime?
   - **Recommendation:** Benchmark after implementation; likely negligible (<1s startup delay)

2. **Optimal backup frequency for each service:**
   - Pi-hole: Daily sufficient? Or more frequent?
   - Grafana: Weekly OK? (Dashboards change infrequently)
   - VictoriaLogs: Daily? Continuous replication?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with daily for critical, weekly for others; adjust based on change frequency

3. **Off-site backup method selection:**
   - rsync to NAS vs. rclone to cloud vs. borg backup?
   - Cost/complexity tradeoffs
   - **Recommendation:** Research backup solutions separately (possible ST-04 topic)

### Low-Confidence Areas

**USB SSD long-term reliability on Le Potato specifically:**
- Most data from Raspberry Pi community (similar but not identical)
- Le Potato USB controller may behave differently
- Real-world testing needed to confirm stability
- **Mitigation:** Start deployment with monitoring; adjust if issues found

**Permission requirements for each specific service image:**
- Official images may run as root or non-root
- Requires per-service testing
- Documentation may not always specify UID/GID
- **Mitigation:** Test permissions after deploying each service; document fixes

**Volume growth rates for VictoriaLogs/Prometheus:**
- Depends on log volume and retention policy
- Difficult to estimate before deployment
- May require adjustment after monitoring real usage
- **Mitigation:** Start with conservative estimates; monitor closely in first month

### Recommended Follow-Up Research

1. **Backup solution comparison (potential ST-04):**
   - Evaluate rsync, rclone, borg, restic, duplicati
   - Compare features, performance, complexity
   - Recommend specific tool for off-site backups

2. **SMART monitoring setup:**
   - Research smartd configuration
   - Alert thresholds for SSD health
   - Integration with Prometheus/Grafana

3. **Volume performance profiling:**
   - Benchmark actual I/O patterns with deployed services
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize if needed

4. **Permission management standardization:**
   - Create reusable entrypoint script template
   - Document common UID/GID mappings
   - Build library of fixes for popular images

## Testing & Validation Plan

### Pre-Implementation Testing

**Before deploying services:**

1. **Verify Docker installation:**
   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker info | grep "Docker Root Dir"
   # Should show /mnt/ssd/docker or /mnt/storage/docker
   ```

2. **Test volume creation:**
   ```bash
   # Create test volume
   docker volume create test-volume

   # Verify location
   docker volume inspect test-volume | grep Mountpoint
   # Should show /mnt/ssd/docker/volumes/test-volume/_data

   # Test write permissions
   docker run --rm -v test-volume:/data ubuntu:22.04 \
     sh -c "echo 'test' > /data/testfile && cat /data/testfile"
   # Should output: test

   # Cleanup
   docker volume rm test-volume
   ```

3. **Test Docker Compose volume management:**
   ```bash
   # Create test compose file
   cat > /tmp/test-compose.yml <<EOF
   services:
     test:
       image: ubuntu:22.04
       command: sleep infinity
       volumes:
         - testdata:/data
   volumes:
     testdata:
       driver: local
       name: test-data
   EOF

   # Deploy
   docker compose -f /tmp/test-compose.yml up -d

   # Verify volume
   docker volume ls | grep test-data

   # Cleanup
   docker compose -f /tmp/test-compose.yml down -v
   rm /tmp/test-compose.yml
   ```

### Post-Implementation Testing

**After deploying each service:**

1. **Verify volume creation:**
   ```bash
   docker volume ls
   # Should list all defined volumes with correct names
   ```

2. **Test data persistence:**
   ```bash
   # For Pi-hole example:
   # 1. Access Pi-hole web UI, make configuration change
   # 2. Restart container
   docker compose restart pihole
   # 3. Verify configuration persisted
   # Access web UI again, check settings
   ```

3. **Test permissions:**
   ```bash
   # Check if service can write to volume
   docker compose logs <service> | grep -i "permission denied"
   # Should show no permission errors

   # Inspect volume ownership
   docker compose exec <service> ls -la /data
   # Should show appropriate user ownership
   ```

4. **Test backup procedure:**
   ```bash
   # Run backup script
   /opt/scripts/backup-volumes.sh

   # Verify backup created
   ls -lh /mnt/backup/docker-volumes/

   # Test restore (on test volume)
   /opt/scripts/restore-volume.sh test-volume /mnt/backup/docker-volumes/test-volume-*.tar.gz
   ```

5. **Test volume survival across container recreate:**
   ```bash
   # Stop and remove container
   docker compose down

   # Verify volume still exists
   docker volume ls | grep pihole-config

   # Recreate container
   docker compose up -d

   # Verify data still present
   docker compose exec pihole ls -la /etc/pihole
   ```

### Success Criteria

- âœ… All volumes created with correct names (no unwanted prefixes)
- âœ… Services successfully write to volumes without permission errors
- âœ… Data persists across container restarts and recreations
- âœ… Volumes located on external SSD (/mnt/ssd/docker/volumes/)
- âœ… Backup script successfully creates tar archives
- âœ… Restore script successfully restores data to clean volume
- âœ… Volume sizes reasonable and within disk capacity
- âœ… No errors in `docker compose logs` related to storage
- âœ… Services function correctly after restore from backup
- âœ… Volumes survive Docker daemon restart

### Rollback Plan

**If volume strategy causes issues:**

1. **Immediate fallback to bind mounts:**
   ```yaml
   # Modify docker-compose.yml
   services:
     pihole:
       volumes:
         # Replace:
         # - pihole-config:/etc/pihole
         # With:
         - /mnt/ssd/pihole/config:/etc/pihole

   # Remove volumes: section
   # Recreate containers
   docker compose up -d --force-recreate
   ```

2. **Migrate data from named volume to bind mount:**
   ```bash
   # Stop service
   docker compose stop pihole

   # Create bind mount directory
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ssd/pihole/config

   # Copy data from named volume
   docker run --rm \
     -v pihole-config:/source:ro \
     -v /mnt/ssd/pihole/config:/target \
     ubuntu cp -a /source/. /target/

   # Update compose file to use bind mount
   # Restart service
   docker compose up -d pihole

   # Verify data intact
   # Remove old volume
   docker volume rm pihole-config
   ```

3. **Revert to SD card storage (emergency only):**
   ```json
   // /etc/docker/daemon.json
   {
     "data-root": "/var/lib/docker"
   }
   ```

   ```bash
   # Stop Docker
   sudo systemctl stop docker

   # Copy volumes back to SD card
   sudo rsync -aAHX /mnt/ssd/docker/volumes/ /var/lib/docker/volumes/

   # Restart Docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

## Confidence Level Justification

**Rating:** ðŸŸ¢ High

**Justification:**

This recommendation is based on official Docker documentation, extensive community consensus, and real-world production deployment experiences. The default local volume driver with named volumes is the most common, well-documented, and field-tested approach for single-host Docker deployments.

**Factors Increasing Confidence:**

1. **Official Docker recommendation:** Docker documentation explicitly recommends named volumes for production persistence

2. **Widespread adoption:** Most Docker tutorials, guides, and production deployments use this approach

3. **Proven on ARM:** Raspberry Pi community extensively uses named volumes on external storage (similar hardware to Le Potato)

4. **Simple and reliable:** No third-party plugins or complex configuration required

5. **Mature feature:** Named volumes have been Docker's standard persistence mechanism since early versions

6. **Comprehensive documentation:** Backup, restore, troubleshooting procedures well-documented

7. **Tool support:** All Docker tools (compose, CLI, Desktop) fully support named volumes

8. **Survival guarantee:** Volumes designed to persist independently of Docker engine lifecycle

**Factors Decreasing Confidence:**

1. **Le Potato-specific testing unavailable:** Most examples from Raspberry Pi; Le Potato may have subtle differences (MINOR - same ARM architecture and USB storage approach)

2. **USB storage reliability concerns:** Professional NAS vendors discourage USB for primary storage (MINOR - acceptable for home server with backups)

3. **Permission issues require service-specific fixes:** No universal solution for non-root containers (MINOR - standard problem with known workarounds)

4. **Backup/restore procedures require testing:** Cannot guarantee recovery without hands-on validation (ADDRESSED - testing plan included)

**Overall confidence remains HIGH** because:
- The approach aligns with official Docker recommendations
- Extensively proven in production environments
- Simple and maintainable (no exotic dependencies)
- Known issues have documented solutions
- Backup strategy provides insurance against edge cases
- ARM community consensus supports this approach

**The only scenario where confidence would decrease:** If post-deployment testing reveals Le Potato-specific storage issues not present on Raspberry Pi, or if USB SSD proves unreliable in practice. These risks are mitigated by monitoring, backups, and documented rollback procedures.

## Reviewer Notes

**Key decisions for review:**

1. **Named volumes vs bind mounts:** Recommendation strongly favors named volumes for production. Agree with this approach?

2. **No third-party drivers:** Recommendation is to use default local driver only. Are there use cases requiring convoy, local-persist, or NFS drivers?

3. **Backup frequency:** Suggested daily for critical services, weekly for others. Should all be daily? Or more granular?

4. **Off-site backup method:** Not specified in detail. Should this be researched separately (potential ST-04 topic)?

5. **Volume naming convention:** Recommended `<service>-<purpose>` format. Any preferences for different convention?

**Areas needing validation:**

1. **Per-service permission requirements:** Need to test each official image (Pi-hole, Grafana, VictoriaMetrics) for UID/GID and fix as needed

2. **Actual volume growth rates:** Estimates provided but need real-world monitoring to validate capacity planning

3. **USB SSD stability on Le Potato:** Assumption based on Raspberry Pi community; requires validation on actual hardware

**Suggested next steps:**

1. Update le-potato-server-spec.md with volume management section
2. Create docker-compose.yml templates for each service with volume definitions
3. Implement backup-volumes.sh and restore-volume.sh scripts
4. Add volume monitoring to Prometheus/Grafana setup (Phase 4)
5. Consider ST-04 research prompt for backup solution comparison
6. Begin Phase 2 implementation with volume strategy in place
