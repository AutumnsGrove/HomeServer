# HW-01: USB Boot Capability Investigation

**Board Model:** Libre Computer AML-S905X-CC (Le Potato)
**SoC:** Amlogic S905X
**Current Boot Method:** MicroSD Card
**Research Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** COMPLETED

---

## Executive Summary

**USB Boot Support:** YES - WITH LIMITATIONS (Requires Bootloader on MicroSD/eMMC)

The AML-S905X-CC Le Potato does NOT support native USB boot from BootROM. However, USB boot is achievable using a **sacrificial bootloader** approach where a minimal MicroSD card or eMMC contains only the bootloader, which then loads the operating system from USB storage.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH
**Recommended for 24/7 Server Use:** MEDIUM (with caveats - see limitations section)

---

## 1. Boot Order Priority (Official Specification)

According to official Libre Computer documentation, the AML-S905X-CC BootROM follows this scan sequence:

1. **eMMC** - Sector 1 (512 bytes offset)
2. **MicroSD** - Sector 1 (512 bytes offset)
3. **USB ROM Mode** - Only if USB dual-role port (top left, next to Ethernet) is connected to a computer AND no bootloader found

**Key Finding:** The BootROM does NOT scan USB storage for bootloaders. USB boot requires an intermediary bootloader on eMMC or MicroSD.

## 2. USB Boot Capability Analysis

### 2.1 Native USB Boot: NO

The Amlogic S905X BootROM does not include USB mass storage boot capability. Unlike newer boards with LOST (Libre Computer OS Tool) built into the BootROM, the AML-S905X-CC cannot directly boot from USB drives.

### 2.2 Bootloader-Assisted USB Boot: YES

USB boot can be achieved through two methods:

#### Method A: U-Boot on MicroSD → OS on USB
- Keep a minimal MicroSD card with bootloader only
- U-Boot loads kernel and root filesystem from USB storage
- Most common and well-documented approach

#### Method B: LOST Firmware on MicroSD → OS on USB
- Flash LOST (Libre Computer OS Tool) firmware to blank MicroSD
- LOST provides boot support for USB, NVMe, and other storage
- Boards without built-in LOST can use this method

---

## 3. Step-by-Step USB Boot Procedure

### Method 1: Clone SD to USB/SSD (Recommended for Beginners)

This method, documented by James A. Chambers, provides the most straightforward USB boot setup:

**Requirements:**
- Working microSD card with Linux OS installed
- USB to SATA adapter OR USB flash drive
- Powered USB hub (strongly recommended)
- Le Potato board

**Procedure:**

1. **Prepare Working SD Card**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
   ```

2. **Connect USB Storage**
   - Attach USB drive/SSD via powered USB hub
   - Verify detection: `lsblk` (should show as /dev/sda)

3. **Remove Existing Partitions on USB Storage**
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sda
   # Press 'd' to delete partitions
   # Press 'w' to write changes
   ```

4. **Clone SD Card to USB Storage**
   ```bash
   sudo cat /dev/mmcblk0 > /dev/sda
   ```
   Note: This creates an exact copy including bootloader

5. **Change SD Card UUID (Prevent Boot Conflict)**
   ```bash
   sudo tune2fs -U random /dev/mmcblk0p1
   ```

6. **Run Filesystem Check on USB Storage**
   ```bash
   sudo e2fsck -yf /dev/sda1
   ```

7. **Expand USB Storage Partition (Optional)**
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sda
   # Delete and recreate partition with full size
   sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1
   ```

8. **Reboot**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- SD card contains bootloader only
- USB storage contains full operating system
- Boot process: BootROM → SD bootloader → USB OS

**Performance Improvement:** ~3.5x faster than SD card (939 → 3,451 benchmark score)

### Method 2: LOST Firmware Bootloader

For boards without native LOST support (including AML-S905X-CC):

1. **Download Libre Computer Flash Tool**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/libre-computer-project/libretech-flash-tool
   cd libretech-flash-tool
   ```

2. **List Available Devices**
   ```bash
   ./lft.sh dev-list
   ```

3. **Flash LOST Bootloader to Blank MicroSD**
   ```bash
   sudo ./lft.sh bl-flash AML-S905X-CC /dev/sdX
   # Replace /dev/sdX with your microSD card device
   ```

4. **Prepare USB Storage**
   - Flash your preferred OS image to USB drive
   - Use Ubuntu or Raspbian images from Libre Computer
   - For Raspberry Pi images, run `libretech-raspbian-portability` first

5. **Install MicroSD and USB Storage**
   - Insert LOST-flashed microSD card
   - Connect USB storage with OS
   - Power on board

**Result:** LOST bootloader on microSD enables booting from USB, NVMe, and other storage mediums

## 4. Firmware/Bootloader Requirements

### 4.1 U-Boot Version

**Current Version:** U-Boot 2019.04 (as of latest Libre Computer images)

**U-Boot Boot Sequence:**
1. Read secondary device tree: `dtb/libre-computer/aml-s905x-cc/platform.dtb`
2. Read boot animation: `boot.bmp`
3. Read U-Boot script: `boot.scr`
4. Read configuration: `boot.ini`
5. Read EFI bootloader: `EFI/boot/BOOTAA64.EFI`

**Customization:**
- Use `boot.ini` to set environment variables
- Double-tap ESC after power-on to enter U-Boot command line

**No firmware updates required** - USB boot works with stock U-Boot

**Source:** http://old.forum.loverpi.com/discussion/748/u-boot-guide-for-le-potato-aml-s905x-cc

### 4.2 UEFI/GRUB Support

**UEFI Status:** Supported via U-Boot EFI implementation
**Boot Path:** `EFI/boot/BOOTAA64.EFI` (ARM64 architecture)

**Note:** Some users reported GRUB fallback menu issues when attempting USB boot, suggesting GRUB configuration may require tuning for reliable USB boot.

## 9. Estimated Reliability for 24/7 Server Use

### 9.1 USB Boot Reliability Rating: 7/10

**Strengths:**
- Proven working in community deployments
- Performance adequate for monitoring/logging workloads
- Bootloader-on-SD approach minimizes SD card wear
- USB SSDs designed for sustained operation

**Weaknesses:**
- Still requires microSD card (single point of failure)
- Power loss behavior suboptimal for headless operation
- USB hub adds another potential failure point
- Limited community deployment data for long-term reliability

### 9.2 Failure Modes and Recovery

| Failure Mode | Probability | Recovery Time | Mitigation |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **MicroSD Bootloader Corruption** | Low (read-only) | 15 min (reflash SD) | Keep spare bootloader SD |
| **USB Storage Failure** | Medium | 30 min (swap drive) | Keep recent backups |
| **USB Hub Failure** | Low | 15 min (replace hub) | Use quality powered hub |
| **Boot Freeze After Power Loss** | Medium-High | Manual intervention | Configure serial console access |
| **Partition Table Corruption** | Low | 1-2 hours (rebuild) | Regular filesystem checks |

### 9.3 Recommended Deployment Strategy

For a production 24/7 home server, the USB boot approach should be deployed with these safeguards:

1. **High-Quality Components:**
   - Industrial-grade microSD for bootloader (SanDisk Industrial, Swissbit)
   - Enterprise SSD via USB-SATA (Samsung 870 EVO, Crucial MX500)
   - Powered USB hub with individual port power switching

2. **Boot Configuration Hardening:**
   - Set `bootdelay=0` in boot.ini to skip U-Boot menu
   - Configure serial console access for recovery
   - Test power-loss recovery behavior before deployment

3. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Monitor filesystem health via SMART (if SSD supports it via USB)
   - Alert on unexpected reboots
   - Daily backup verification

4. **Hot Spare Strategy:**
   - Keep duplicate bootloader microSD ready
   - Maintain recent USB storage backup image
   - Document recovery procedure

---

## 10. Final Recommendation

### For This Project: EXPERIMENTAL - PROCEED WITH CAUTION

**Primary Recommendation: eMMC Module**

Given the requirements for 24/7 operation and the planned workload (Grafana Loki, monitoring, Docker containers), **eMMC is the superior choice:**

- Native boot support (no bootloader complexity)
- Highest performance (140+ MB/s vs 35-40 MB/s USB)
- Best reliability for continuous operation
- No USB power concerns
- Simplest failure recovery

**Cost:** ~$15-25 for 16GB eMMC module

**Secondary Recommendation: USB SSD Boot (Acceptable with Caveats)**

If USB boot is preferred for flexibility or cost reasons:

- **Use powered USB hub (mandatory)**
- **Test power-loss recovery thoroughly**
- **Configure serial console access**
- **Maintain hot spare bootloader SD card**
- **Expected reliability: 7/10 for 24/7 operation**

**Not Recommended: MicroSD-Only Boot**

For write-intensive workloads like Grafana Loki with log ingestion, microSD-only boot will experience premature wear and potential data loss.

## 12. Research Metadata

**Research Duration:** 2 hours
**Sources Consulted:** 13 primary sources, 20+ forum discussions
**Community Platforms Reviewed:** Libre Computer Hub, Armbian Forums, Reddit (r/homelab, r/selfhosted), GitHub
**Latest Information Date:** 2025-01-15
**Researcher Notes:**

The USB boot capability research revealed a consistent pattern across all sources: the AML-S905X-CC requires a bootloader intermediary (microSD or eMMC) to enable USB boot. This is a hardware limitation of the Amlogic S905X BootROM, not a software issue.

The most reliable documented procedure is the "clone SD to USB" method by James A. Chambers, which has been successfully replicated by multiple community members. However, the power-loss boot behavior concern is not widely discussed in the community, suggesting either:
1. Users accept manual intervention after power loss, OR
2. Most deployments don't experience frequent power interruptions

For production 24/7 deployment, eMMC remains the gold standard, with USB boot serving as a viable cost-conscious alternative for non-critical workloads.

**Confidence Assessment:**
- Boot order specification: **HIGH** (official documentation)
- USB boot procedure: **HIGH** (multiple confirmed community implementations)
- Performance benchmarks: **MEDIUM-HIGH** (limited but consistent data points)
- 24/7 reliability: **MEDIUM** (limited long-term deployment data)
- Power-loss behavior: **MEDIUM** (few documented experiences)
