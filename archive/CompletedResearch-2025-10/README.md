# Completed Research - October 2025

**Research Phase:** Le Potato Home Server Project
**Date Range:** October 11-12, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

This directory contains the complete research findings from the initial planning phase of the Le Potato Home Server project. All 17 research prompts were successfully completed, resulting in comprehensive documentation that informed the v2.0 project specification.

## Research Results

**Total Documents:** 19 files
- 17 specific research findings (HW, SW, ST, MON categories)
- 1 synthesis document (SYN-01)
- 1 critical path summary

**Research Coverage:**
- **Hardware (HW):** 4 prompts - USB boot, USB specs, power requirements, thermal management
- **Software (SW):** 5 prompts - Pi-hole networking, Grafana/Loki, Docker storage, Claude Code ARM, happy.engineering
- **Storage (ST):** 4 prompts - Filesystem choice, log relocation, Docker volumes, backup solutions
- **Monitoring (MON):** 3 prompts - Log retention, dashboard templates, alert notifications
- **Synthesis (SYN):** 1 prompt - Integrated architecture recommendations

## Key Outcomes

### Major Architecture Changes
Based on research findings, several critical design changes were made:

1. **Monitoring Stack:** Changed from Loki to VictoriaLogs (87% RAM reduction)
2. **Boot Strategy:** Changed from microSD/USB to eMMC (4× faster, more reliable)
3. **Cooling:** Changed from passive to active cooling (mandatory for 24/7 operation)
4. **Power Architecture:** Added powered USB hub requirement (mandatory for storage stability)
5. **Filesystem:** Confirmed ext4 over btrfs (better Docker performance)

### Research Impact
- **Overall Confidence:** 90% (HIGH)
- **Project Status:** GO - Ready for implementation
- **Prevented Issues:** Multiple potential showstoppers identified and addressed
- **Cost Savings:** Avoided purchasing incompatible hardware
- **Time Savings:** Clear implementation path defined
