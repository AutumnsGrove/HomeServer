## Executive Summary

### Project Feasibility: ✅ **CONFIRMED GO**

After comprehensive research across 16 documents covering hardware, software, storage, and monitoring considerations, the Le Potato home server project is **FEASIBLE** with specific architectural modifications. The 2GB RAM constraint is the tightest bottleneck, requiring careful service selection and resource allocation. All critical services are ARM-compatible, and with proper component selection (powered USB hub, eMMC storage, active cooling), the system can achieve 24/7 reliability.

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Powered USB Hub:** Mandatory for external storage stability
2. **VictoriaLogs over Loki:** 87% RAM reduction enables monitoring stack to fit
3. **eMMC Boot Storage:** Superior reliability and performance vs microSD/USB boot
4. **Active Cooling:** Required for sustained Docker workloads
5. **ext4 Filesystem:** Best Docker performance and simplicity for this use case

### Resource Budget (2GB RAM Total)

```
System Base (Ubuntu 22.04):     ~400MB
Pi-hole + Tailscale:            ~200MB
VictoriaLogs + Grafana:         ~670MB
Netdata:                        ~150MB
System buffers/cache:           ~200MB
-------------------------------------------
Total committed:                ~1620MB
Available headroom:             ~380MB (19%)
Development container:          On-demand, mutually exclusive with monitoring
```

### Key Architectural Changes from Original Concept

| Original Plan | Modified Decision | Reason |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Grafana Loki monitoring | VictoriaLogs primary, Loki fallback | 87% less RAM, 3× faster ingestion |
| USB boot from SSD | eMMC module boot | Native support, 4× faster, more reliable |
| btrfs filesystem | ext4 with rsync backups | Better Docker performance, simpler recovery |
| Generic cooling | Active cooling required (heatsink + 3010 fan) | Prevents 60°C throttling in <5 min |
| Single USB SSD | Powered USB hub + dual SSDs | Power stability, prevents boot loops |
| Host mode networking | Bridge with Tailscale service container | Clean Tailscale integration, no port conflicts |

## 1. Architecture Revisions & Critical Decisions

### 1.1 Boot & Storage Architecture

**DECISION: eMMC Boot + External USB SSDs via Powered Hub**

**Rationale:**
- **HW-01 findings:** USB boot requires sacrificial bootloader on microSD, adds complexity and failure point
- **HW-02 findings:** USB 2.0 only (35-40 MB/s), powered hub mandatory for stability
- **HW-03 findings:** Direct USB storage causes boot loops without external power
- **ST-01 findings:** ext4 outperforms btrfs for Docker small-file workloads

**Implementation:**
```
Boot Flow: eMMC (16GB) → Ubuntu Server 22.04 + Docker Engine
           ↓
External Storage:
  - Primary SSD (1TB): /mnt/storage/docker (Docker volumes + app data)
  - Secondary SSD (1TB): /mnt/storage/logs + backups (optional)
  - Both via Sabrent powered USB hub (36W minimum)

Filesystem: ext4 with:
  - noatime,nodiratime (reduce writes)
  - errors=remount-ro (safety on corruption)
  - 1% reserved space (vs default 5%)
```

**Performance Expectations:**
- eMMC boot: 140+ MB/s read, 170+ MB/s write
- USB SSD: 35-40 MB/s (USB 2.0 bottleneck, still 2× faster than microSD)
- Docker image pull: Acceptable for home server (3-5 min for typical images)

### 1.2 Monitoring Stack Architecture

**DECISION: VictoriaLogs + VictoriaMetrics + Grafana + Netdata**

**Rationale:**
- **SW-02 findings:** Loki uses 1.5GB+ RAM under load, excessive for 2GB system
- **SW-02 findings:** VictoriaLogs uses 87% less RAM than Loki (200MB vs 1.5GB)
- **SW-02 findings:** 3× higher ingestion speed, 72% less CPU on ARM
- **MON-01 findings:** 5-7 day retention sufficient for home server with 2GB RAM

**Resource Allocation:**
```yaml
grafana:          256MB limit  (128MB reserved)
victorialogs:     200MB limit  (128MB reserved)
vmagent:          64MB limit   (32MB reserved)
netdata:          150MB limit  (100MB reserved)
---------------------------------------------------
Total:            670MB committed
Safety margin:    Fits within 700-900MB available budget
```

**Fallback Option:** If VictoriaLogs ARM compatibility issues arise, documented Loki configuration with aggressive limits (256MB) available but NOT recommended.

### 1.3 Network Architecture

**DECISION: Pi-hole with Tailscale Service Container Networking**

**Rationale:**
- **SW-01 findings:** `network_mode: service:tailscale` provides seamless VPN integration
- **SW-01 findings:** No port conflicts with host systemd-resolved
- **SW-01 findings:** Clean separation, proven 24/7 stability

**Configuration:**
```yaml
services:
  tailscale:
    image: tailscale/tailscale:latest
    cap_add: [NET_ADMIN, SYS_MODULE]
    volumes:
      - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
      - tailscale-state:/var/lib/tailscale

  pihole:
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    network_mode: service:tailscale  # Shares Tailscale network namespace
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
```

**DNS Flow:**
```
Tailscale clients → Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x) → Pi-hole container
                                               ↓
                                         Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 (upstream)
```

### 1.4 Thermal Management

**DECISION: Active Cooling Required (Heatsink + 3010 5V Fan)**

**Rationale:**
- **HW-04 findings:** CPU throttles to 100MHz at 60°C in <5 minutes with 25%+ load
- **HW-04 findings:** Combined Docker workload will sustain 25-60% CPU usage
- **HW-04 findings:** Heatsink alone: 20°C reduction; + fan: additional 10-15°C

**Implementation:**
- **Heatsink:** Libre Computer official heatsink (covers SoC + RAM)
- **Fan:** 3010 5V (2.5-5 CFM, 22-26 dBA)
- **Case:** LoveRPi Active Cooling Case or equivalent with ventilation
- **Power:** Fan draws 0.75W (0.15A @ 5V) from GPIO pins
- **Monitoring:** Grafana alert at 55°C warning, 58°C critical

**Expected Temperatures (with active cooling):**
- Idle: 35-42°C
- Normal operation (30-50% CPU): 48-55°C
- Peak load (80-100% CPU): 55-60°C (no throttling)

### 1.5 Power Architecture

**DECISION: 5V 3A PSU for Board + Dedicated Powered USB Hub**

**Rationale:**
- **HW-03 findings:** Le Potato max 1A, USB budget 2A = 3A total needed
- **HW-03 findings:** Each SSD draws 0.5-0.9A (2.5-4.5W), exceeds USB port budget
- **HW-03 findings:** Direct USB storage causes boot loops, crashes, instability

**Implementation:**
```
Power Supply:
  - Le Potato: GenBasic 5V 3A MicroUSB PSU (UL certified, <5.5V max)
  - USB Hub: Sabrent/Anker powered hub (36W minimum for 3 SSDs)

Power Budget:
  - Board + fan: 5W typical, 10W peak
  - Each SSD: 4.5W typical, 10W peak (during spin-up)
  - Hub provides isolation and startup current handling
```

**Critical:** Attempting to power SSDs directly from Le Potato USB ports **will fail**. This is non-negotiable.

# Start dev container
cd ~/docker/devenv
docker-compose up -d

# Access via SSH
ssh user@lepotato.local
# Inside: docker exec -it devenv bash
# Inside container: claude --version
```

## 8. Conflict Resolution & Trade-offs

### Identified Conflicts

#### Conflict 1: RAM Budget Tension
**Issue:** VictoriaLogs (200MB) + Grafana (256MB) + Netdata (150MB) + Pi-hole (512MB) + dev container (512MB) = 1630MB > available 1400MB

**Resolution:**
- Development container is **mutually exclusive** with full monitoring stack
- When doing development work: `cd ~/docker/monitoring && docker-compose stop`
- When monitoring is priority: `cd ~/docker/devenv && docker-compose stop`
- Document this clearly in operations runbook

**Trade-off accepted:** Flexibility to switch between modes vs. always-on development environment

#### Conflict 2: Storage Performance vs. Reliability
**Issue:** USB 2.0 (40MB/s) slower than eMMC (140MB/s) or Raspberry Pi 4 USB 3.0 (300MB/s)

**Resolution:**
- Accept USB 2.0 limitation (hardware constraint)
- eMMC for OS/critical services (fast, reliable)
- USB SSD for Docker volumes (adequate, better than microSD)
- Optimize workloads for sequential I/O patterns

**Trade-off accepted:** 3× slower storage vs. upgrading to different board (cost ~$100)

#### Conflict 3: btrfs Snapshots vs. Docker Performance
**Issue:** btrfs offers native snapshots but significantly slower for Docker small-file workloads

**Resolution:**
- Use ext4 for Docker volumes (better performance)
- Implement rsync-based snapshots with hard links (similar functionality)
- Accept manual backup process vs. native filesystem snapshots

**Trade-off accepted:** Snapshot convenience vs. Docker container performance

#### Conflict 4: Comprehensive Monitoring vs. RAM Budget
**Issue:** Full Prometheus + Loki + Grafana stack requires 1.5-2GB RAM alone

**Resolution:**
- VictoriaLogs (87% less RAM than Loki)
- Netdata instead of Prometheus (lighter weight)
- 5-7 day retention instead of 30 days
- Accept reduced historical data vs. comprehensive long-term metrics

**Trade-off accepted:** Historical depth vs. fitting within RAM budget

### Non-Negotiable Requirements

These were identified as **must-have** through research and cannot be compromised:

1. ✅ **Powered USB hub:** Direct USB storage will fail, no exceptions
2. ✅ **Active cooling:** Will throttle without it, no viable workaround
3. ✅ **eMMC or high-quality boot media:** MicroSD cards fail under 24/7 writes
4. ✅ **ext4 for Docker volumes:** btrfs performance penalty too severe
5. ✅ **VictoriaLogs over Loki:** Loki will OOM-kill with 2GB RAM
6. ✅ **Tailscale service container networking:** Cleanest architecture, proven stable

---

## 9. Alternative Approaches Considered

### Alternative 1: Raspberry Pi 4 Instead of Le Potato
**Considered because:** USB 3.0 (10× faster), more community support, slightly more RAM (2GB/4GB)

**Rejected because:**
- Cost difference (~$20 more)
- USB 2.0 adequate for workload (not storage-intensive)
- Le Potato already owned
- Architectural solutions work for both platforms

**Verdict:** Not worth switching, optimize for Le Potato

### Alternative 2: Grafana Cloud Instead of Self-Hosted Monitoring
**Considered because:** Zero local RAM usage, unlimited retention, professional alerting

**Rejected because:**
- Free tier limited (50GB logs/month, 10k series)
- Defeats purpose of self-hosted project
- Network dependency (internet required for visibility)
- Data leaves premises (privacy concern for home server)

**Verdict:** Keep self-hosted, use VictoriaLogs optimization

### Alternative 3: btrfs with Heavy Optimization
**Considered because:** Native snapshots, data checksums, compression

**Rejected because:**
- Research shows 50-80 IOPS vs 120-150 IOPS (ext4) for Docker workloads
- Complexity of scrubs, balance operations, snapshot management
- Worse recovery tools (btrfs check less mature than e2fsck)
- USB 2.0 exacerbates btrfs CoW overhead

**Verdict:** ext4 with rsync snapshots simpler and faster

### Alternative 4: Kubernetes Instead of Docker Compose
**Considered because:** Better orchestration, self-healing, industry standard

**Rejected because:**
- K3s minimum viable: 512MB overhead (too much for 2GB system)
- Complexity overkill for 3-5 containers
- Learning curve high for home server
- Docker Compose sufficient for this scale

**Verdict:** Docker Compose is appropriate scale

### Alternative 5: Proxmox VE for Virtualization
**Considered because:** VM isolation, flexibility, snapshot support

**Rejected because:**
- Proxmox itself uses 1-1.5GB RAM
- Leaves only 500MB for actual workloads
- Virtualization overhead significant on ARM
- No compelling benefit for single-purpose server

**Verdict:** Bare-metal Docker is correct approach

## 11. Operational Procedures

### Standard Operating Procedures

#### Starting the Server (After Reboot or Power Loss)
```bash
# 1. Physical verification
# - Check fan is spinning (audible and visual)
# - Verify USB hub power light on
# - Check all USB devices connected

# 2. Wait for boot (1-2 minutes from eMMC)
# - SSH should become available

# 3. Verify system health
ssh user@lepotato.local
/usr/local/bin/daily-health-check.sh

# 4. Verify core services
cd ~/docker/pihole && docker-compose ps
cd ~/docker/monitoring && docker-compose ps

# 5. Test DNS resolution
nslookup google.com  # Should resolve through Pi-hole

# 6. Check Grafana accessibility
# Open http://lepotato.local:3000 (via Tailscale)
```

#### Switching Between Monitoring and Development Modes
```bash
# Switch to DEVELOPMENT mode (stop monitoring)
cd ~/docker/monitoring
docker-compose stop  # Frees ~670MB RAM
echo "Monitoring stopped. Available RAM: $(free -h | awk 'NR==2 {print $7}')"

cd ~/docker/devenv
docker-compose up -d
echo "Development environment started"

# Switch to MONITORING mode (stop development)
cd ~/docker/devenv
docker-compose stop  # Frees ~512MB RAM

cd ~/docker/monitoring
docker-compose up -d
echo "Monitoring stack started"
```

#### Planned Maintenance Window
```bash
# 1. Announce downtime (if applicable)
# Send notification via Grafana/Slack

# 2. Stop services gracefully
cd ~/docker/monitoring
docker-compose down  # Graceful shutdown

cd ~/docker/pihole
docker-compose down

# 3. Perform maintenance
# - Update packages: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
# - Clean Docker: docker system prune -af
# - Check disk space: df -h
# - Inspect cooling: visually check for dust

# 4. Reboot if needed
sudo reboot

# 5. Verify all services after reboot
# Follow "Starting the Server" procedure
```

#### Emergency Troubleshooting

**Symptom: System unresponsive or very slow**
```bash
# Via SSH (if accessible):
free -h  # Check RAM usage
docker stats --no-stream  # Check container memory
/usr/local/bin/temp-check.sh  # Check for throttling

# If temp >58°C:
# - Check fan operation
# - Clear case vents of dust
# - Verify fan power connection

# If memory >90%:
docker-compose -f ~/docker/monitoring/docker-compose.yml stop  # Free RAM
# Or reboot: sudo reboot
```

**Symptom: Pi-hole DNS not working**
```bash
# Check Pi-hole container status
docker ps | grep pihole

# Check Tailscale connectivity
docker exec tailscale-pihole tailscale status

# Verify Pi-hole internal DNS
docker exec pihole pihole status

# Check Tailscale DNS settings
# Go to: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns
# Verify Pi-hole Tailscale IP is listed

# Test DNS directly
nslookup google.com $(docker exec tailscale-pihole tailscale ip -4)
```

**Symptom: High temperature despite cooling**
```bash
# Check current temperature
cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp | awk '{print $1/1000 "°C"}'

# Verify fan is running
# Listen for fan noise
# Check power: gpio readall (if GPIO library installed)

# Check for throttling
watch -n 2 'cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq'
# Should show ~1512000 (1.5GHz), not 100000 (100MHz)

# If fan not running:
# - Check GPIO connections (Pin 4: 5V, Pin 6: GND)
# - Try connecting to 3.3V (Pin 1) instead
# - Replace fan if defective

# If fan running but temp high:
# - Re-seat heatsink (check thermal paste)
# - Verify case ventilation not blocked
# - Check ambient room temperature
```

### Backup Procedures

**Daily Incremental Backup (Automated)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/bin/daily-backup.sh

BACKUP_DIR="/mnt/storage-secondary/backups"
SOURCE_DIR="/mnt/storage-primary"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Create backup with rsync
rsync -av --delete \
  --link-dest="$BACKUP_DIR/latest" \
  "$SOURCE_DIR/" \
  "$BACKUP_DIR/backup-$DATE/"

# Update latest symlink
rm -f "$BACKUP_DIR/latest"
ln -s "$BACKUP_DIR/backup-$DATE" "$BACKUP_DIR/latest"

# Prune old backups (keep 7 days)
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "backup-*" -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} \;

echo "Backup completed: $BACKUP_DIR/backup-$DATE"
```

**Schedule:** `0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/daily-backup.sh >> /var/log/backup.log 2>&1`

**Manual Backup Before Major Changes**
```bash
# Before system updates or configuration changes
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
sudo rsync -av /mnt/storage-primary/ /mnt/storage-secondary/manual-backup-$DATE/
echo "Manual backup created: manual-backup-$DATE"
```

**Restoration Procedure**
```bash
# List available backups
ls -lh /mnt/storage-secondary/backups/

# Restore specific backup
sudo rsync -av /mnt/storage-secondary/backups/backup-20251011/ /mnt/storage-primary/

# Or restore from latest
sudo rsync -av /mnt/storage-secondary/backups/latest/ /mnt/storage-primary/

# Restart services after restoration
cd ~/docker/pihole && docker-compose restart
cd ~/docker/monitoring && docker-compose restart
```

## 13. Lessons Learned & Key Insights

### Research Findings That Changed The Plan

1. **VictoriaLogs Discovery (SW-02)**
   - **Original plan:** Use Grafana Loki (industry standard)
   - **Research finding:** Loki uses 1.5GB+ RAM, VictoriaLogs uses 200MB (87% reduction)
   - **Impact:** Made monitoring stack viable on 2GB system
   - **Confidence:** Medium (newer project, but ARM-optimized)

2. **USB Power Requirements (HW-02, HW-03)**
   - **Original assumption:** USB SSDs could be powered directly from Le Potato
   - **Research finding:** Each SSD needs 0.5-0.9A (4.5W), board budget only 2A total
   - **Impact:** Powered USB hub became mandatory, not optional
   - **Confidence:** High (multiple sources, clear power calculations)

3. **60°C Throttling Threshold (HW-04)**
   - **Original assumption:** Passive cooling sufficient
   - **Research finding:** CPU throttles to 100MHz at 60°C in <5 minutes with 25%+ load
   - **Impact:** Active cooling (heatsink + fan) required, not nice-to-have
   - **Confidence:** High (community consensus, clear thermal data)

4. **ext4 vs btrfs for Docker (ST-01)**
   - **Original preference:** btrfs for snapshots and data integrity
   - **Research finding:** btrfs 50-80 IOPS vs ext4 120-150 IOPS for Docker workloads
   - **Impact:** Changed to ext4 + rsync for backups
   - **Confidence:** High (Docker official recommendation, performance benchmarks)

5. **eMMC vs USB Boot (HW-01)**
   - **Original plan:** Boot from USB SSD
   - **Research finding:** eMMC 4× faster (140MB/s vs 35MB/s), native boot priority
   - **Impact:** eMMC became preferred boot solution
   - **Confidence:** High (official specs, proven reliability)

### Critical Gotchas Discovered

1. **systemd-resolved Port Conflict**
   - **Issue:** Ubuntu 22.04 runs systemd-resolved on port 53 by default
   - **Impact:** Pi-hole cannot bind to port 53 without disabling it
   - **Solution:** Must disable systemd-resolved before deploying Pi-hole
   - **Source:** SW-01 findings

2. **32-bit Node.js on 64-bit OS**
   - **Issue:** Some ARM installation methods install 32-bit Node.js
   - **Impact:** Claude Code detects "arm" instead of "arm64" and refuses to run
   - **Solution:** Verify `node -p "process.arch"` returns "arm64" not "arm"
   - **Source:** SW-04 findings

3. **Docker Storage Driver Deprecation**
   - **Issue:** Docker removed btrfs storage driver in v23.0
   - **Impact:** Even if btrfs filesystem used, overlay2 driver required
   - **Solution:** Use overlay2 on ext4 (recommended path)
   - **Source:** ST-01 findings

4. **Tailscale Key Expiry**
   - **Issue:** Auth keys expire after 90 days by default
   - **Impact:** DNS stops working when key expires
   - **Solution:** Disable key expiry in Tailscale admin or use OAuth client
   - **Source:** SW-01 findings

5. **USB Hub Bandwidth Sharing**
   - **Issue:** All devices on hub share 480Mbps (60MB/s) USB 2.0 bandwidth
   - **Impact:** Multiple SSDs with simultaneous I/O limited to ~10-15MB/s each
   - **Solution:** Optimize for sequential I/O, avoid parallel heavy workloads
   - **Source:** HW-02 findings

### Research Quality Assessment

**Highest Confidence Areas:**
- Hardware specifications (USB, power, thermal)
- Docker performance characteristics
- ARM software compatibility
- Proven deployment patterns

**Medium Confidence Areas:**
- VictoriaLogs long-term stability on ARM
- Long-term eMMC reliability (3+ years)
- Exact RAM usage under full load

**Lower Confidence Areas:**
- Le Potato-specific quirks vs. general ARM SBC behavior
- Performance with specific workload patterns
- Long-term thermal paste degradation timeline

### What Would We Research Differently?

1. **Hands-on testing:** Physical validation of power, thermal, and performance characteristics would increase confidence significantly.

2. **Community outreach:** Direct contact with Le Potato users running similar workloads would provide real-world validation.

3. **Vendor confirmation:** Direct confirmation from Libre Computer on USB power specs and thermal management recommendations.

4. **Benchmark suite:** Creating a standardized test suite to compare documented specs vs. actual performance.

## 20. Conclusion

### Final Verdict: ✅ **PROJECT IS GO**

The Le Potato home server project is **architecturally sound and feasible** within the 2GB RAM constraint. The research has identified all major risks and provided clear mitigation strategies. Critical component selections (VictoriaLogs, eMMC, ext4, powered hub, active cooling) enable 24/7 reliable operation that would not be possible with the original architecture assumptions.

### Critical Success Factors Summary

**The project will succeed IF:**
1. ✅ Powered USB hub is used (non-negotiable)
2. ✅ Active cooling is installed (heatsink + 3010 fan)
3. ✅ VictoriaLogs is used instead of Loki (87% RAM savings)
4. ✅ eMMC boot is used instead of USB/microSD boot
5. ✅ Memory limits are strictly enforced on all containers
6. ✅ Development and monitoring modes are mutually exclusive

**The project will fail IF:**
- USB SSDs powered directly from Le Potato (boot loops, crashes)
- Passive cooling only (throttling to 100MHz in <5 minutes)
- Loki used without modifications (will OOM-kill)
- microSD-only boot with heavy writes (will fail within months)
- No monitoring of temperature/memory (silent degradation)

### Confidence in Success

**Overall confidence:** 🟢 **HIGH (90%)**

This confidence is justified by:
- 16 research documents providing comprehensive coverage
- All critical paths researched with high confidence findings
- Proven components and architectures (not experimental)
- Clear constraints and explicit trade-off analysis
- Multiple fallback options for uncertain areas
- Detailed implementation roadmap with validation checkpoints

**Remaining 10% uncertainty:**
- VictoriaLogs ARM long-term stability (newer, less proven)
- Exact RAM usage under full combined load (monitoring + dev)
- Long-term hardware reliability (eMMC endurance, thermal paste degradation)
- Le Potato-specific quirks vs. general ARM SBC behavior

These uncertainties are **acceptable and manageable** through:
- Fallback configurations (Loki if VictoriaLogs fails)
- Continuous monitoring (detect issues early)
- Operational procedures (mode switching, maintenance schedule)
- Documented troubleshooting (quick resolution of issues)

### Ready for Implementation

This synthesis document provides everything needed to proceed with implementation:
- ✅ Complete hardware shopping list with specifications
- ✅ Finalized software stack with version recommendations
- ✅ Phase-by-phase implementation roadmap
- ✅ Configuration examples for all major services
- ✅ Validation checkpoints and success criteria
- ✅ Troubleshooting procedures and fallback plans
- ✅ Operational procedures for ongoing management

**Next immediate step:** Proceed to Phase 0 (hardware acquisition) following the implementation roadmap in Section 5.
