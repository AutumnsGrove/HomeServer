## Detailed Findings

### HW-02: USB Port Specifications ⚠️

**Research File:** `HW-02-USB-Port-Specifications.md` (20KB)
**Confidence:** 🟢 High

**Critical Discovery:**
- Le Potato has **4x USB 2.0 ports ONLY** (no USB 3.0)
- SoC (Amlogic S905X) does not support USB 3.0
- Maximum throughput: 35 MB/s read, 25 MB/s write
- All ports share 480 Mbps bandwidth

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Single SSD: 30-41 MB/s read, 17-35 MB/s write
- Multiple SSDs: Bandwidth shared equally (~10-15 MB/s each for 3 drives)
- 3.5× faster than microSD card
- 100 Mbps Ethernet is bigger bottleneck than USB 2.0

**Power Issues:**
- Per port: 500 mA @ 5V (2.5W standard USB 2.0)
- SSDs draw: 0.5-2A each (exceeds port budget)
- **Mandatory:** Powered USB hub required for 2+ SSDs

**24/7 Stability Requirements:**
1. ✅ Powered USB hub (Sabrent 2.5A USB power recommended)
2. ✅ Quality 5V @ 3A power supply
3. ✅ eMMC module for OS (optional but recommended)

**Known Issues:**
- Boot loops when external drives connected directly
- USB hub disconnections without powered hub
- All resolved with proper powered hub setup

**Suitability for Your Workload:**
- ✅ Logging (sequential writes): Perfect for USB 2.0
- ✅ Pi-hole (DNS queries): Negligible I/O
- ✅ Docker volumes: Adequate for light workloads
- ⚠️ NAS file serving: Limited by 100 Mbps Ethernet anyway
- ⚠️ 3 SSDs simultaneously: Bandwidth shared, but workable

**Recommendations:**
1. Acquire powered USB hub: Sabrent 7-port 36W ($35) or Anker 10-port 60W ($50)
2. Consider eMMC module: 32-64GB for OS + Docker engine ($20-40)
3. External SSDs: 1-2× 1TB drives for data/logs ($60 each)
4. USB-to-SATA adapters: StarTech USB 3.1 to 2.5" SATA ($15 each)

**Alternatives if USB 3.0 Required:**
- Libre Computer Renegade: USB 3.0, 305 MB/s read (~$50)
- Odroid HC4: Dual SATA bays, NAS-focused (~$65)
- Raspberry Pi 4: USB 3.0, better support (~$55)

### HW-03: Power Supply Requirements ⚠️

**Research File:** `HW-03-Power-Requirements.md` (38KB)
**Confidence:** 🟢 High

**Power Budget Analysis:**

| Component | Idle | Typical | Peak |
|-----------|------|---------|------|
| Le Potato | 0.8W | 1.5W | 4W |
| Fan | 0.5W | 0.5W | 0.5W |
| SSD (each) | 0.3W | 3W | 4.5W |
| **3 SSDs Total** | **2.2W** | **11W** | **17.5W** |

**Critical Finding:**
- Le Potato USB budget: 2A (10W) across all 4 ports
- Three SSDs need: Up to 13.5W (exceeds budget)
- **Result:** Powered hub is NOT optional, it's mandatory

**Recommended Power Solution:**

1. **For Le Potato Board:**
   - GenBasic 5V 3A MicroUSB Power Supply ($12)
   - UL certified, stays below 5.5V maximum
   - Official Libre Computer partner product

2. **For External Storage:**
   - Anker 10-Port 60W Powered USB Hub ($50) OR
   - Sabrent 7-Port 36W Hub ($35)
   - Powers all SSDs independently from board
   - Proven 24/7 reliability

**Total Power Cost:** $47-62

**Critical Warnings:**

❌ **DO NOT:**
- Use Raspberry Pi 3 power supplies (often >5.5V - can damage board)
- Use cheap "3A" MicroUSB supplies (dangerous over-voltage)
- Connect 2+ SSDs directly to Le Potato USB ports
- Run production workloads without powered hub

**Known Power Issues:**
- Boot loops when HDDs/SSDs connected without powered hub
- USB disconnections after 3-5 minutes with inadequate PSU
- Top-left USB port crashes on kernel 4.14 (use bottom-right)

**Testing Requirements:**
- 48-hour stability test before production deployment
- Monitor for voltage drops, USB disconnections, boot issues
- Validate with `dmesg` and `lsusb` commands

**Confidence Justification:**
- Official manufacturer power profile documented
- USB 2.0 specification clearly defines 500mA limits
- Multiple community reports confirm necessity
- Physics-based calculations validate recommendations

### SW-02: Grafana/Loki Resource Requirements ⚠️

**Research File:** `SW-02-Grafana-Loki-Resources.md` (39KB, 1071 lines)
**Confidence:** 🟡 Medium-High

**Executive Summary:**
- Monitoring stack CAN run on 2GB RAM (tight but feasible)
- **Recommendation:** Use VictoriaLogs instead of Loki
- 87% less RAM than Loki, 3× faster ingestion, 72% less CPU

**Memory Budget Breakdown:**

```
Component                RAM Used
──────────────────────────────────
Ubuntu Server:           ~400MB
Pi-hole:                 ~150MB
Tailscale:                ~50MB
System overhead:         ~200MB
Development container:   ~500MB (on-demand, NOT concurrent)
──────────────────────────────────
Available for monitoring: ~700MB (dev stopped)
                         ~200MB (dev running)
```

**Recommended Stack: VictoriaLogs (Total: 670MB)**

| Component | Memory Limit | Reservation |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Grafana | 256MB | 128MB |
| VictoriaLogs | 200MB | 128MB |
| vmagent (log shipper) | 64MB | 32MB |
| Netdata (system metrics) | 150MB | 100MB |
| **Total** | **670MB** | **388MB** |

**Fallback Stack: Loki (Total: 726MB)**

| Component | Memory Limit |
|-----------|--------------|
| Grafana | 256MB |
| Loki | 256MB |
| Promtail | 64MB |
| Netdata | 150MB |
| **Total** | **726MB** |

**Why VictoriaLogs:**
- ✅ 87% less RAM than Loki (confirmed benchmarks)
- ✅ 3× faster ingestion with 72% less CPU
- ✅ Specifically optimized for ARM devices
- ✅ Production ready for single-node deployments
- ✅ Compatible with Grafana (drop-in replacement)

**Key Constraints:**
- 5-day log retention (vs 7-day goal) to save space
- Dev container and monitoring likely need dynamic start/stop
- Pi-hole has priority if memory pressure occurs
- Query complexity must be limited to prevent OOM

**Docker Compose Configuration Provided:**
- Complete VictoriaLogs stack (ready to deploy)
- Complete Loki stack (fallback)
- Ultra-lightweight option (Netdata only, 320MB)
- Resource limits, health checks, volume mappings

**Critical Risks & Mitigations:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| OOM kills during queries | Hard memory limits, swap as safety net |
| Conflict with dev container | Stop monitoring when dev active |
| Pi-hole instability | Pi-hole gets priority, monitor for <200MB free |
| Storage exhaustion | 5-day retention, log filtering, alerts at 70% |

**Alternative Options:**
1. Loki stack (if VictoriaLogs incompatible)
2. Netdata only (no log aggregation) - 320MB total
3. Ship logs to Grafana Cloud free tier (eliminates local overhead)
4. Scheduled monitoring (run 6am-midnight, stop overnight)

**Testing Required:**
- Deploy WITHOUT Pi-hole for 48-hour burn-in
- Add Pi-hole and monitor for conflicts
- Test dev container concurrency
- Validate 5-day retention sufficient

**Confidence Rationale:**
- Medium-High (not High) due to no direct Le Potato testing
- Extrapolated from Raspberry Pi (similar ARM Cortex-A53)
- Conservative resource allocation with safety margins
- Multiple fallback options identified

**Architecture Impact:**
1. Change Phase 6 from Loki to VictoriaLogs
2. Add Phase 2.5: Configure zram swap (512MB)
3. Move monitoring AFTER self-healing (Phase 8)
4. Document service priority: Pi-hole > Monitoring > Dev
