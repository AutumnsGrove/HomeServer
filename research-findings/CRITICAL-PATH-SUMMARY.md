**Executive Summary:**
- Monitoring stack CAN run on 2GB RAM (tight but feasible)
- **Recommendation:** Use VictoriaLogs instead of Loki
- 87% less RAM than Loki, 3× faster ingestion, 72% less CPU

**Memory Budget Breakdown:**

```
Component                RAM Used
──────────────────────────────────
Ubuntu Server:           ~400MB
Pi-hole:                 ~150MB
Tailscale:                ~50MB
System overhead:         ~200MB
Development container:   ~500MB (on-demand, NOT concurrent)
──────────────────────────────────
Available for monitoring: ~700MB (dev stopped)
                         ~200MB (dev running)
```

**Recommended Stack: VictoriaLogs (Total: 670MB)**

| Component | Memory Limit | Reservation |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Grafana | 256MB | 128MB |
| VictoriaLogs | 200MB | 128MB |
| vmagent (log shipper) | 64MB | 32MB |
| Netdata (system metrics) | 150MB | 100MB |
| **Total** | **670MB** | **388MB** |

**Fallback Stack: Loki (Total: 726MB)**

| Component | Memory Limit |
|-----------|--------------|
| Grafana | 256MB |
| Loki | 256MB |
| Promtail | 64MB |
| Netdata | 150MB |
| **Total** | **726MB** |

**Why VictoriaLogs:**

- Dev container and monitoring likely need dynamic start/stop
- Pi-hole has priority if memory pressure occurs
- Query complexity must be limited to prevent OOM

**Docker Compose Configuration Provided:**
- Complete VictoriaLogs stack (ready to deploy)
- Complete Loki stack (fallback)
- Ultra-lightweight option (Netdata only, 320MB)
- Resource limits, health checks, volume mappings

**Critical Risks & Mitigations:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| OOM kills during queries | Hard memory limits, swap as safety net |
| Conflict with dev container | Stop monitoring when dev active |
| Pi-hole instability | Pi-hole gets priority, monitor for <200MB free |
| Storage exhaustion | 5-day retention, log filtering, alerts at 70% |

**Alternative Options:**
1. Loki stack (if VictoriaLogs incompatible)
2. Netdata only (no log aggregation) - 320MB total
3. Ship logs to Grafana Cloud free tier (eliminates local overhead)
4. Scheduled monitoring (run 6am-midnight, stop overnight)

**Testing Required:**
- Deploy WITHOUT Pi-hole for 48-hour burn-in
- Add Pi-hole and monitor for conflicts
- Test dev container concurrency
- Validate 5-day retention sufficient

**Confidence Rationale:**
- Medium-High (not High) due to no direct Le Potato testing
- Extrapolated from Raspberry Pi (similar ARM Cortex-A53)
- Conservative resource allocation with safety margins
- Multiple fallback options identified

**Architecture Impact:**
1. Change Phase 6 from Loki to VictoriaLogs
2. Add Phase 2.5: Configure zram swap (512MB)
3. Move monitoring AFTER self-healing (Phase 8)
4. Document service priority: Pi-hole > Monitoring > Dev

### HW-04: Thermal Management for 24/7 Operation ⚠️

**Research File:** `HW-04-Thermal-Management.md` (48KB, 1126 lines)
**Confidence:** 🟢 High

**Executive Summary:**
- Le Potato requires active cooling for reliable 24/7 operation
- Thermal throttling at 60°C occurs in <5 minutes with 25%+ CPU usage
- Heatsink + 3010 fan combination is essential for sustained workloads
- Temperature monitoring integration with Grafana is critical

**Critical Discovery:**
- **Throttling threshold:** 60°C (CPU drops to 100MHz - 97% performance loss)
- **Time to throttle (no cooling):** <5 minutes at 25%+ CPU load
- **Docker workload impact:** Combined services will push 30-60% sustained CPU
- **Current cooling assessment:** User has "small fan + external case (unspecified)" - verification needed

**Safe Operating Temperatures:**
- Idle: 35-45°C (with proper cooling)
- Typical load (25-50% CPU): 45-55°C
- Heavy load (75% CPU): 52-58°C
- **WARNING zone:** 58°C+ (throttling imminent)
- **CRITICAL:** 60°C+ (throttling active, performance degraded)

**Cooling Effectiveness:**
| Solution | Temp Reduction | Suitability |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| No cooling | Baseline | ❌ Throttles in <5 min |
| Heatsink only | -20°C | ⚠️ Marginal for 24/7 |
| Heatsink + 3010 fan | -30-35°C | ✅ Recommended |

**Recommended Cooling Solution:**
1. **Heatsink:** Libre Computer official (aluminum, covers CPU + RAM)
   - Temperature reduction: ~20°C
   - Cost: $5-8

2. **Active Cooling:** 3010 5V fan
   - Specifications: 2.5-5 CFM, 22-26 dBA, 0.75W power draw
   - Additional temp reduction: 10-15°C
   - Cost: $3-5

3. **Case:** LoveRPi Active Cooling Case (official recommendation)
   - Integrated fan mount and heatsink support
   - Proper ventilation design
   - Cost: $10-15

**Total cooling cost:** $15-25

**Temperature Monitoring Implementation:**

1. **Direct thermal reading:**
```bash
cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
# Returns millidegrees: 45000 = 45°C
```

2. **Grafana Integration:**
   - Node Exporter exposes: `node_thermal_zone_temp{zone="0"}`
   - Dashboard ID 15202: "Node Exporter / Node Temperatures"
   - Alert thresholds:
     - ⚠️ Warning: 55°C (review cooling)
     - 🔴 Critical: 58°C (imminent throttling)
     - 🚨 Emergency: 60°C+ (throttling active)

3. **Monitoring tools:**
   - lm-sensors package
   - Custom monitoring script (provided in research)
   - Grafana dashboard with temperature alerts

**Workload-Specific Temperature Profile:**

| Workload Scenario | CPU Usage | Expected Temp | Risk |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------|------|
| Pi-hole + Tailscale | 15-20% | 42-45°C | None |
| + Grafana idle | 20-25% | 45-48°C | None |
| + Loki ingestion | 30-40% | 48-52°C | None |
| + Samba transfer | 50-70% | 52-56°C | Very Low |
| + Dev build | 80-100% | 56-60°C | Low |

**Thermal Issues in Generic S905X Devices:**
- Poorly ventilated TV boxes: 80-90°C under load
- Case removal drops temps from 83°C to <60°C
- Le Potato advantage: Open board format allows proper cooling

**Known Issues & Workarounds:**
1. **Fan runs too loud:** Connect to 3.3V instead of 5V (60% speed, quieter)
2. **sensors command shows nothing:** Use direct sysfs reading (more reliable)
3. **Throttling despite fan:** Check heatsink contact, re-apply thermal paste
4. **Temperature spikes on container start:** Normal; ensure cooling handles sustained load

**Critical Warnings:**

❌ **DO NOT:**
- Run 24/7 server without active cooling (will throttle under load)
- Ignore temperature monitoring (throttling occurs silently)
- Block case ventilation (intake/exhaust paths critical)
- Assume current setup is adequate without verification

**Validation Testing Required:**
1. ✅ Measure baseline temperature (idle and under load)
2. ✅ Run stress test: `stress-ng --cpu 4 --timeout 600s`
3. ✅ Monitor during test: Watch for 60°C threshold
4. ✅ Verify no throttling: Check CPU frequency stays at 1.5 GHz
5. ✅ Integrate with Grafana: Add temperature dashboard and alerts

**Longevity Considerations:**
- **1-3 year continuous operation:** Achievable with proper cooling (<55°C sustained)
- **Early warning signs:** Gradual temperature increases (thermal paste degradation)
- **Maintenance schedule:**
  - Quarterly: Clean dust from case and fan
  - Annually: Re-apply thermal paste if needed
- **Thermal monitoring:** Essential for detecting cooling failures before damage

**Risks & Mitigations:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Fan failure undetected | Medium | High | Temperature monitoring with alerts |
| Dust accumulation | High | Medium | Quarterly cleaning schedule |
| Thermal throttling during peak | Low | High | Active cooling + monitoring |
| Case ventilation inadequate | Medium | High | Verify airflow before deployment |

**Architecture Impact:**
1. Add cooling hardware to Phase 0 procurement:
   - Heatsink: $5-8
   - 3010 5V fan: $3-5
   - Active cooling case: $10-15
   - **Total: $15-25**

2. Add thermal monitoring to Phase 2 (Monitoring Stack):
   - Import Grafana temperature dashboard (ID 15202)
   - Configure alert rules (55°C warning, 58°C critical)
   - Run 10-minute stress test for baseline
   - Document baseline temps for comparison

3. Add maintenance tasks:
   - Quarterly: Case cleaning (dust removal)
   - Annually: Thermal paste refresh (if temps increase)
   - Ongoing: Temperature trend monitoring

**Alternatives if Cooling Insufficient:**
1. Reduce workload (disable non-critical containers)
2. Improve ambient cooling (air conditioning, room fans)
3. Use larger/secondary fan
4. Implement PWM fan control for dynamic cooling
5. Relocate to cooler environment

**Documentation Provided:**
- ✅ Complete installation guide (heatsink, fan, case)
- ✅ Temperature monitoring setup (sysfs, lm-sensors, Grafana)
- ✅ Docker Compose config for monitoring integration
- ✅ Stress testing procedures
- ✅ Alert rule configurations

2. Measure baseline temperature (idle and stress test)
3. Install temperature monitoring (immediate priority)
4. Upgrade cooling if needed (heatsink + fan + case)
5. Run 48-hour stability test before production deployment

**Confidence Justification:**
- ✅ 60°C throttling threshold confirmed by multiple sources
- ✅ Cooling effectiveness quantified (20°C heatsink, 10-15°C fan)
- ✅ Real-world 24/7 deployment experiences documented
- ✅ Temperature monitoring approach is standardized
- ✅ Case and fan recommendations from official sources
- ⚠️ No Le Potato-specific long-term reliability data (extrapolated from S905X community)
