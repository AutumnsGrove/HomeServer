## 5-Minute Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure you have:
# - Claude Code installed
# - Git installed
# - Python 3.8+ (for visualizations)
# - Node.js 18+ (for Tavily, optional)
```

### Step 1: Project Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir my-research-project
cd my-research-project

# Initialize git
git init

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p research-findings research-viz tools .claude

# Download system files
# (Or copy from your existing setup)

# Create initial README
echo "# My Research Project" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "chore: initialize project"
```

### Step 2: Configure Permissions (1 minute)

Create `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Read", "Write", "Edit", "Glob", "Grep",
      "WebSearch",
      "Task",
      "Bash(git *)",
      "Bash(ls *)",
      "Bash(cat *)",
      "Bash(find *)",
      "Bash(grep *)",
      "Bash(mkdir *)",
      "Bash(echo *)",
      "Bash(python *)",
      "Bash(pip *)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm *)",
      "Bash(mv *)",
      "Bash(sudo *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Launch Research Session (2 minutes)

In Claude Code:

```markdown
I need to research [YOUR TOPIC].

Please follow this workflow:

1. Run Scout (PERMISSION-INIT-AGENT.md) to pre-approve tools
2. Run Conductor (ORCHESTRATOR-WITH-PERSONALITIES.md) to orchestrate research
3. Use the team personalities system

Research topic: [Describe your topic]
```

**That's it!** The system will:
- Pre-approve tools (Scout)
- Clarify requirements (Conductor)
- Launch research waves (Specialized agents)
- Create visualizations (Prism)
- Synthesize findings (Maven)
- Document the journey (Historian)

---

## Complete Workflow

### Phase 0: Permission Initialization (30 seconds)

**Agent:** 🔵 Scout  
**Action:** Pre-approve all tools for autonomous operation

```markdown
Run Scout following PERMISSION-INIT-AGENT.md
```

**What happens:**
- Scout makes sample calls to all tools
- You approve the batch once
- Rest of session runs uninterrupted

**Result:** ✅ Tools pre-approved for session

---

### Phase 1: Requirements Clarification (5-10 minutes)

**Agent:** 🟣 Conductor  
**Action:** Understand your needs before deploying team

```markdown
Conductor, please clarify requirements for this research project:
[Your initial request]
```

**What happens:**
- Conductor asks clarifying questions
- You provide specifics
- Conductor creates research plan
- You approve the plan

**Result:** ✅ Clear research plan with priorities

---

### Phase 2: Research Execution (1-4 hours, autonomous)

**Agents:** 🟤 Atlas, 🟢 Nova, 🔴 Cipher, 🟡 Sage (and others)  
**Action:** Parallel research in waves

```markdown
Conductor, please deploy the research team per our approved plan.
```

**What happens:**
- Wave 1 (Critical): 4 agents research in parallel
- Decision gate: Feasible? Continue or pivot?
- Wave 2 (High): Next priority agents
- Wave 3 (Medium): Further details
- Wave 4 (Low): Nice-to-haves

**Result:** ✅ 10-20 comprehensive research documents

---

### Phase 3: Visualization (30 minutes)

**Agent:** 🌈 Prism  
**Action:** Convert data to visual insights

```markdown
Prism, please create visualizations based on research findings.
```

**What happens:**
- Prism identifies visualization opportunities
- Creates charts, graphs, comparison matrices
- Outputs publication-ready graphics

**Result:** ✅ 3-10 visualizations in research-viz/

---

### Phase 4: Synthesis (30-60 minutes)

**Agent:** 🟠 Maven  
**Action:** Integrate all findings into coherent document

```markdown
Maven, please synthesize all research into final document.
```

**What happens:**
- Maven reads all research documents
- Resolves any conflicts
- Assesses overall feasibility
- Creates implementation roadmap
- Integrates visualizations

**Result:** ✅ Comprehensive synthesis document

---

### Phase 5: Retrospective (15 minutes)

**Agent:** âš« Historian  
**Action:** Document the research journey

```markdown
Historian, please create the behind-the-scenes retrospective.
```

**What happens:**
- Historian reviews all work
- Collects statistics
- Captures team "voices"
- Documents key moments
- Creates engaging narrative

**Result:** ✅ Fun, insightful retrospective

## Git Worktree Workflow

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Create worktrees for each wave
git worktree add worktrees/wave1-critical research/wave1-critical
git worktree add worktrees/wave2-high research/wave2-high
git worktree add worktrees/wave3-medium research/wave3-medium

# Work in each worktree
cd worktrees/wave1-critical/
# ... research happens ...
git commit -m "feat: complete critical path research"

# Merge back to main
cd ../../
git merge --no-ff research/wave1-critical

# Cleanup
git worktree remove worktrees/wave1-critical/
```

**See:** `GIT-WORKTREE-WORKFLOW.md` for complete guide

---

## Tavily Integration (Optional)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Method 1: Project-local config
# Create .claude/mcp-config.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tavily": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tavily/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "TAVILY_API_KEY": "tvly-YOUR-KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}

# Method 2: Python wrapper (if MCP doesn't work)
pip install tavily-python
# Use tools/research_helper.py
```

**See:** `TAVILY-CLAUDE-CODE-SETUP.md` for all methods

---

## Customization Examples

### Customize for Your Domain

**Hardware Research:**
```json
{
  "team": ["Scout", "Conductor", "Atlas", "Cipher", "Sage", "Maven", "Historian"],
  "focus": "hardware_compatibility"
}
```

**Software Architecture:**
```json
{
  "team": ["Scout", "Conductor", "Nova", "Cipher", "Sage", "Maven", "Historian"],
  "focus": "architecture_design"
}
```

**Security Audit:**
```json
{
  "team": ["Scout", "Conductor", "Cipher", "Nova", "Sage", "Maven", "Historian"],
  "focus": "security_assessment"
}
```

### Adjust Research Depth

**Light Research (< 1 hour):**
- 1 wave, 3-4 agents
- 5-7 research documents
- Basic synthesis
- No retrospective

**Standard Research (2-4 hours):**
- 3 waves, 10-12 agents
- 10-15 research documents
- Full synthesis
- Full retrospective

**Deep Research (6-12 hours):**
- 4-5 waves, 15-20 agents
- 20-30 research documents
- Comprehensive synthesis with visualizations
- Detailed retrospective

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tools not pre-approved

**Solution:** Run Scout again or manually approve tools

### Issue: Research interrupted

**Solution:** 
1. Check `.claude/settings.local.json` permissions
2. Run Scout to pre-approve more tools
3. Use accept-edits mode for file operations

### Issue: Git conflicts

**Solution:**
1. Use worktrees for parallel work
2. Ensure waves are properly sequenced
3. Review `GIT-WORKTREE-WORKFLOW.md`

### Issue: Agent personalities not showing

**Solution:**
1. Ensure using `ORCHESTRATOR-WITH-PERSONALITIES.md`
2. Explicitly request personality system
3. Check team member definitions

### Issue: Tavily not working

**Solution:**
1. Try all methods in `TAVILY-CLAUDE-CODE-SETUP.md`
2. Fallback to Python API wrapper
3. Use regular web_search as alternative

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Run Scout First

Pre-approve tools before starting research. Saves 20-50 interruptions per session.

### 2. Let Conductor Clarify

Don't skip requirements clarification. 5-10 minutes here saves hours of wrong research.

### 3. Trust the Personalities

Let agents write in their voice. It makes research more engaging and memorable.

### 4. Use Worktrees for Parallel Work

If running 3+ research waves, use worktrees. Cleaner workflow, no branch switching chaos.

### 5. Read the Retrospective

Historian's behind-the-scenes document captures lessons learned. Read it!

### 6. Customize Team Composition

Not every research needs all 9 agents. Choose specialists relevant to your topic.

### 7. Archive Completed Projects

```bash
# After research complete
git tag -a research-complete-v1.0 -m "Research phase complete"
git push origin research-complete-v1.0
```

### 8. Document Your Setup

Create a `PROJECT-README.md` explaining:
- What you researched
- Which agents you used
- Any customizations
- Lessons learned
